This kind of polynomial plays an all-dominant role in stability checks of electrical (analog or digital) networks.\\ In this article we prove that a polynomial $p$ can be shown to be Hurwitz by checking whether the rational function $e(p)/o(p)$ can be realized as a reactance of one port, that is as an electrical impedance or admittance consisting of inductors and capacitors. Here $e(p)$ and $o(p)$ denote the even and the odd part of $p$ \cite{Unb93}.   },

    SUMMARY = {The notion of a rough set, developed by Pawlak \cite{Pawlak1982}, is an important tool to describe situation of incomplete or partially unknown information. In this article, which is essentially the continuation of \cite{ROUGHS_1.ABS}, we try to give the characterization of approximation operators in terms of ordinary properties of underlying relations (some of them, as serial and mediate relations, were not available in the Mizar Mathematical Library). Here we drop the classical equivalence- and tolerance-based models of rough sets \cite{SkowronS96} trying to formalize some parts of \cite{Zhu:2007} following also \cite{Yao96} in some sense (Propositions 1--8, Corr. 1 and 2; the complete description is available in the Mizar script). Our main problem was that informally, there is a direct correspondence between relations and underlying properties, in our approach however \cite{GrabowskiJ10}, which uses relational structures rather than relations, we had to switch between classical (based on pure set theory) and abstract (using the notion of a structure) parts of the Mizar Mathematical Library. Our next step will be translation of these properties into the pure language of Mizar attributes.   },

    SUMMARY = {The binary set $\{0,1\}$ together with modulo-2 addition and multiplication is called a binary field, which is denoted by $\mathbb{F}_2$. The binary field $\mathbb{F}_2$ is defined in \cite{BSPACE.ABS}. A vector space over $\mathbb{F}_2$ is called a binary vector space. The set of all binary vectors of length $n$ forms an $n$-dimensional vector space $V_n$ over $\mathbb{F}_2$. Binary fields and $n$-dimensional binary vector spaces play an important role in practical computer science, for example, coding theory \cite{ECC:2006} and cryptology. In cryptology, binary fields and $n$-dimensional binary vector spaces are very important in proving the security of cryptographic systems \cite{Lai1994}. In this article we define the $n$-dimensional binary vector space $V_n$. Moreover, we formalize some facts about the $n$-dimensional binary vector space $V_n$.   },

    SUMMARY = {We first provide a modified version of the proof in \cite{TOPGEN_5.ABS} that the Sorgenfrey line is $T_1$. Here, we prove that it is in fact $T_2$, a stronger result. Next, we prove that all subspaces of ${\mathbb R}^{\bf 1}$ (that is the real line with the usual topology) are Lindel\"of. We utilize this result in the proof that the Sorgenfrey line is Lindel\"of, which is based on the proof found in \cite{Engelking:1968}. Next, we construct the Sorgenfrey plane, as the product topology of the Sorgenfrey line and itself. We prove that the Sorgenfrey plane is not Lindel\"of, and therefore the product space of two Lindel\"of spaces need not be Lindel\"of. Further, we note that the Sorgenfrey line is regular, following from \cite{TOPGEN_5.ABS}:59. Next, we observe that the Sorgenfrey line is normal since it is both regular and Lindel\"of. Finally, we prove that the Sorgenfrey plane is not normal, and hence the product of two normal spaces need not be normal. The proof that the Sorgenfrey plane is not normal and many of the lemmas leading up to this result are modelled after the proof in \cite{TOPGEN_5.ABS}, that the Niemytzki plane is not normal. Information was also gathered from \cite{SteenSeebach:1978}.   },

    SUMMARY = {In the article the formal characterization of triangular numbers (famous from \cite{Gauss:1986} and words ``EYPHKA! num = $\Delta + \Delta + \Delta$") \cite{Heath:1921} is given. Our primary aim was to formalize one of the items (\#42) from Wiedijk's Top 100 Mathematical Theorems list \cite{Freek-100-theorems}, namely that the sequence of sums of reciprocals of triangular numbers converges to 2. This Mizar representation was written in 2007. As the Mizar language evolved and attributes with arguments were implemented, we decided to extend these lines and we characterized polygonal numbers.\par We formalized centered polygonal numbers, the connection between triangular and square numbers, and also some equalities involving Mersenne primes and perfect numbers. We gave also explicit formula to obtain from the polygonal number its ordinal index. Also selected congruences modulo 10 were enumerated. Our work basically covers the Wikipedia item for triangular numbers and the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (\url{http://oeis.org/A000217}). \par An interesting related result \cite{Guy:1994} could be the proof of Lagrange's four-square theorem or Fermat's polygonal number theorem \cite{Weil:1983}.   },

The last theorem establishes the integrability of continuous functions on the closed interval of reals.

We also stated some properties of finite sequences of elements of a real normed space and finite sequences of real numbers.\par In addition we proved some theorems about the convergence of sequences.

    SUMMARY = {In the article the formal characterization of square-free numbers is shown; in this manner the paper is the continuation of \cite{MOEBIUS1.ABS}. Essentially, we prepared some lemmas for convenient work with numbers (including the proof that the sequence of prime reciprocals diverges \cite{PFTB}) according to \cite{HardyWright} which were absent in the Mizar Mathematical Library. Some of them were expressed in terms of clusters' registrations, enabling automatization machinery available in the Mizar system. Our main result of the article is in the final section; we proved that the lattice of positive divisors of a positive integer $n$ is Boolean if and only if $n$ is square-free.   },

     SUMMARY = {In this article, we formalize the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). AES, which is the most widely used symmetric cryptosystem in the world, is a block cipher that was selected by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as an official Federal Information Processing Standard for the United States in 2001 \cite{FIPS:197}. AES is the successor to DES \cite{DESCIP_1.ABS}, which was formerly the most widely used symmetric cryptosystem in the world. We formalize the AES algorithm according to \cite{FIPS:197}. We then verify the correctness of the formalized algorithm that the ciphertext encoded by the AES algorithm can be decoded uniquely by the same key. Please note the following points about this formalization: the AES round process is composed of the {\tt SubBytes}, {\tt ShiftRows}, {\tt MixColumns}, and {\tt AddRoundKey} transformations (see \cite{FIPS:197}). In this formalization, the {\tt SubBytes} and {\tt MixColumns} transformations are given as permutations, because it is necessary to treat the finite field GF($2^8$) for those transformations. The formalization of AES that considers the finite field GF($2^8$) is formalized by the future article.   },

     SUMMARY = {Category theory was formalized in Mizar with two different approaches \cite{CAT_1.ABS}, \cite{ALTCAT_1.ABS} that correspond to those most commonly used \cite{MacLane:1}, \cite{Borceaux}. Since there is a one-to-one correspondence between objects and identity morphisms, some authors have used an approach that does not refer to objects as elements of the theory, and are usually indicated as object-free category \cite{Adamek:2009} or as arrows-only category \cite{MacLane:1}. In this article is proposed a new definition of an object-free category, introducing the two properties: left composable and right composable, and a simplification of the notation through a symbol, a binary relation between morphisms, that indicates whether the composition is defined. In the final part we define two functions that allow to switch from the two definitions, with and without objects, and it is shown that their composition produces isomorphic categories.   },

     SUMMARY = {The article continues the formalization of the lattice theory (as structures with two binary operations, not in terms of ordering relations). In the Mizar Mathematical Library, there are some attempts to formalize prime ideals and filters; one series of articles written as decoding \cite{CCL} proven some results; we tried however to follow \cite{LOPCLSET.ABS}, \cite{OPENLATT.ABS}, and \cite{LATTICE4.ABS}. All three were devoted to the Stone representation theorem \cite{StoneRepr} for Boolean or Heyting lattices. The main aim of the present article was to bridge this gap between general distributive lattices and Boolean algebras, having in mind that the more general approach will eventually replace the common proof of aforementioned articles.\footnote{As one of the anonymous reviewers pointed out, it would be interesting to show counterexamples showing that the assumptions of the distributivity and boundedness are necessary, and this will be our plan for future work as basic examples of non-distributive lattices are available as of now only as relational structures.} \par Because in Boolean algebras the notions of ultrafilters, prime filters and maximal filters coincide, we decided to construct some concrete examples of ultrafilters in nontrivial Boolean lattice. We proved also the Prime Ideal Theorem not as BPI (Boolean Prime Ideal), but in the more general setting.\par In the final section we present Nachbin theorems \cite{Nachbin}, \cite{Balbes} expressed both in terms of maximal and prime filters and as the unordered spectra of a lattice \cite{Gratzer2011}, \cite{Gratzer}. This shows that if the notion of maximal and prime filters coincide in the lattice, it is Boolean.   },

     SUMMARY = {In the article the formal characterization of preference spaces \cite{Arrow} is given. As the preference relation is one of the very basic notions of mathematical economics \cite{Hallden}, it prepares some ground for a more thorough formalization of consumer theory (although some work has already been done -- see \cite{ARROW.ABS}). There was an attempt to formalize similar results in Mizar, but this work seems still unfinished \cite{Kuzyka}. \par There are many approaches to preferences in literature. We modelled them in a rather illustrative way (similar structures were considered in \cite{PCS_0.ABS}): either the consumer (strictly) prefers an alternative, or they are of equal interest; he/she could also have no opinion of the choice. Then our structures are based on three relations on the (arbitrary, not necessarily finite) set of alternatives. The completeness property can however also be modelled, although we rather follow \cite{Aumann} which is more general \cite{Schumm}. Additionally we assume all three relations are disjoint and their set-theoretic union gives a whole universe of alternatives. \par We constructed some positive and negative examples of preference structures; the main aim of the article however is to give the characterization of consumer preference structures in terms of a binary relation, called characteristic relation \cite{Panek}, and to show the way the corresponding structure can be obtained only using this relation. Finally, we show the connection between tournament and total spaces and usual properties of the ordering relations.   },

It is based on \cite{Kawamoto-Nakamura:1996}. Colored Petri net has already been defined in \cite{PETRI_2.ABS}. In addition, the conditions of the firing rule and the colored set to this definition, that defines the cell Petri nets are further extended to CPNT.i further. The synthesis of two Petri nets was introduced in \cite{PETRI_2.ABS} and in this work the definition is extended to produce the synthesis of a family of colored Petri nets. Specifically, the extension to a CPNT family is performed by specifying how to link the outbound transitions of each colored Petri net to the place elements of other nets to form a neighborhood relationship. Finally, the activation of colored Petri nets was formalized.   },

    SUMMARY = {In this article, we describe the differential equations on functions from $\mathbb R$ into real Banach space. The descriptions are based on the article \cite{ORDEQ_01.ABS}. As preliminary to the proof of these theorems, we proved some properties of differentiable functions on real normed space. For the proof we referred to descriptions and theorems in the article \cite{NDIFF_4.ABS} and the article \cite{NDIFF_5.ABS}. And applying the theorems of Riemann integral introduced in the article \cite{INTEGR21.ABS}, we proved the ordinary differential equations on real Banach space. We referred to the methods of proof in \cite{Schwartz:1967}.   },

First part of the article, devoted to product and flat posets has a purely mathematical quality. Definition 3 allows to construct a flat poset from arbitrary non-empty set \cite{Davey:2002} in order to provide formal apparatus which eanbles to work with recursive calls within the Mizar langauge. To achieve this we extensively use technical Mizar functors like \verb!BaseFunc! or \verb!RecFunc!. The remaining part builds the background for information engineering approach for lists, namely recursive call for posets \cite{Winskel:1993}. We formalized some facts from Chapter 8 of this book as an introduction to the next two sections where we concentrate on binary product of posets rather than on a more general case.   },

    SUMMARY = {In this article we prove the Tietze extension theorem for an arbitrary convex compact subset of ${\cal E}^n$ with a non-empty interior. This theorem states that, if $T$ is a normal topological space, $X$ is a closed subset of $T$, and $A$ is a convex compact subset of ${\cal E}^n$ with a non-empty interior, then a continuous function $f:X \rightarrow A$ can be extended to a continuous function $g:T\rightarrow {\cal E}^n$. Additionally we show that a subset $A$ is replaceable by an arbitrary subset of a topological space that is homeomorphic with a convex compact subset of ${\cal E}^n$ with a non-empty interior. This article is based on \cite{DUDA:BM61}; \cite{Engelking:1989} and \cite{Engelking:1978} can also serve as reference books.   },

    SUMMARY = {In this article we focus on a special case of the Brouwer invariance of domain theorem. Let us $A$, $B$ be a subsets of ${\cal E}^n$, and $f:A \rightarrow B$ be a homeomorphic. We prove that, if $A$ is closed then $f$ transform the boundary of $A$ to the boundary of $B$; and if $B$ is closed then $f$ transform the interior of $A$ to the interior of $B$. These two cases are sufficient to prove the topological invariance of dimension, which is used to prove basic properties of the $n$-dimensional manifolds, and also to prove basic properties of the boundary and the interior of manifolds, e.g. the boundary of an $n$-dimension manifold with boundary is an $(n-1)$-dimension manifold.

As a result, we have equality of three type sums of non-negative double sequence. In section 3 we show that if a non-negative sequence is summable, then the squence of rearrangement of terms is summable and it has the same sums. In the last section two basic relations between double sequences and matrices are introduced.   },

    SUMMARY = {Rough sets, developed by Pawlak, are an important model of incomplete or partially known information. In this article, which is essentially a continuation of \cite{ROUGHS_1.ABS}, we characterize rough sets in terms of topological closure and interior, as the approximations have the properties of the Kuratowski operators. We decided to merge topological spaces with tolerance approximation spaces. As a testbed for our developed approach, we restated the results of Isomichi \cite{ISOMICHI} (formalized in Mizar in \cite{ISOMICHI.ABS}) and about fourteen sets of Kuratowski \cite{KURAT:4} (encoded with the help of Mizar adjectives and clusters' registrations in \cite{KURATO_1.ABS}) in terms of rough approximations. The upper bounds which were 14 and 7 in the original paper of Kuratowski, in our case are six and three, respectively. \par It turns out that within the classification given by Isomichi, $1^{\rm st}$ class subsets are precisely crisp sets, $2^{\rm nd}$ class subsets are proper rough sets, and there are no $3^{\rm rd}$ class subsets in topological spaces generated by approximations. Also the important results about these spaces is that they are extremally disconnected \cite{TDLAT_3.ABS}, hence lattices of their domains are Boolean. \par Furthermore, we develop the theory of abstract spaces equipped with maps possessing characteristic properties of rough approximations which enables us to freely use the notions from the theory of rough sets and topological spaces formalized in the Mizar Mathematical Library \cite{GrabowskiFI:2013}.   },

It states that the arithmetic mean of a list of a non-negative real numbers is greater than or equal to the geometric mean of the same list. \par The formalization was tempting for at least two reasons: one of them, perhaps the strongest, was that the proof of this theorem seemed to be relatively easy to formalize (e.g. the weaker variant of this was proven in \cite{SERIES_3.ABS}). Also Jensen's inequality is already present in the Mizar Mathematical Library. We were impressed by the beauty and elegance of the simple proof by induction and so we decided to follow this specific way. \par The proof follows similar lines as that written in Isabelle \cite{Cauchy-AFP}; the comparison of both could be really interesting as it seems that in both systems the number of lines needed to prove this are really close. \par This theorem is item {\tt{\#38}} from the ``Formalizing 100 Theorems" list maintained by Freek Wiedijk at \url{http://www.cs.ru.nl/F.Wiedijk/100/} .   },

We partially prove the theorem of \cite{Schwabhauser:1983} that Tarski's (extremely weak!) plane geometry axioms imply Hilbert's axioms. Specifically, we obtain Gupta's amazing proof which implies Hilbert's axiom \verb!I1! that two points determine a line. \par The primary Mizar coding was heavily influenced by \cite{INCSP_1.ABS} on axioms of incidence geometry. The original development was much improved using Mizar adjectives instead of predicates only, and to use this machinery in full extent, we have to construct some models of Tarski geometry. These are listed in the second section, together with appropriate registrations of clusters. Also models of Tarski's geometry related to real planes were constructed.   },

    SUMMARY = {Let  us recall that a topological space $M$ is a topological manifold if $M$ is second-countable Hausdorff and locally Euclidean, i.e. each point has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open ball of ${\cal E}^n$ for some $n$. However, if we would like to consider a topological manifold with a boundary, we have to extend this definition. Therefore, we introduce here the concept of a locally Euclidean space that covers both cases (with and without a boundary), i.e. where each point has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to a closed ball of ${\cal E}^n$ for some $n$. \par Our purpose is to prove, using the Mizar formalism, a number of properties of such locally Euclidean spaces and use them to demonstrate basic properties of a manifold. Let $T$ be a locally Euclidean space. We prove that every interior point of $T$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open ball and that every boundary point of $T$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to a closed ball, where additionally this point is transformed into a point of the boundary of this ball. When $T$ is $n$-dimensional, i.e. each point of $T$ has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to a closed ball of ${\cal E}^n$, we show that the interior of $T$ is a locally Euclidean space without boundary of dimension $n$ and the boundary of $T$ is a locally Euclidean space without boundary of dimension $n-1$. Additionally, we show that every connected component of a compact locally Euclidean space is a locally Euclidean space of some dimension. We prove also that the Cartesian product of locally Euclidean spaces also forms a locally Euclidean space. We determine the interior and boundary of this product and show that its dimension is the sum of the dimensions of its factors. At the end, we present several consequences of these results for topological manifolds. This article is based on \cite{ENGEL:BM51}.   },

      SUMMARY = {In this article, we formalize some basic facts of $\mathbb Z$-module. In the first section, we discuss the rank of submodule of $\mathbb Z$-module and its properties. Especially, we formally prove that the rank of any $\mathbb Z$-module is equal to or more than that of its submodules, and vice versa, and that there exists a submodule with any given rank that satisfies the above condition. In the next section, we mention basic facts of linear transformations between two $\mathbb Z$-modules. In this section, we define homomorphism between two $\mathbb Z$-modules and deal with kernel and image of homomorphism. In the last section, we formally prove some basic facts about linearly independent subsets and linear combinations. These formalizations are based on \cite{BourbakiAlgI}(p.191-242), \cite{lang-algebra}(p.117-172) and \cite{atiyah1969introduction}(p.17-35).   },

    SUMMARY = {We consider special events of Borel sets with the aim to prove, that the set of the irrational numbers is an event of the Borel sets. The set of the natural numbers, the set of the integer numbers and the set of the rational numbers are countable, so we can use the literature \cite{analysis1:2001} (pp. 78-81) as a basis for the similar construction of the proof. Next we prove, that different sets can construct the Borel sets \cite{klenke:2006} (pp. 9-10). Literature \cite{klenke:2006} (pp. 9-10) and \cite{georgii:2004} (pp. 11-12) gives an overview, that there exists some other sets for this construction. Last we define special functions as random variables for stochastic finance in discrete time. The relevant functions are implemented in the article \cite{FINANCE1.ABS}, see \cite{follmerschied:2004} (p. 4). The aim is to construct events and random variables, which can easily be used with a probability measure. See as an example theorems (10) and (14) in \cite{RANDOM_3.ABS}. Then the formalization is more similar to the presentation used in the book \cite{follmerschied:2004}. As a background, further literatures is \cite{bosch:2008} (pp. 9-12), \cite{analysisheuser:2003} (pp. 17-20), and \cite{linalgfischer:2002} (pp.32-35).   },

A general formula allowing factorization of the sum of like powers is introduced and used to prove elementary theorems for natural numbers. \par Formulas for short multiplication are sometimes referred in English or French as remarkable identities. The same formulas could be found in works concerning polynomial factorization, where there exists no single term for various identities. Their usability is not questionable, and they have been successfully utilized since for ages. For example, in his books published in 1731 (p. 385), Edward Hatton \cite{Hatton1731} wrote: ``Note, that the differences of any two like powers of two quantities, will always be divided by the difference of the quantities without any remainer...". \par Despite of its conceptual simplicity, the problem of factorization of sums/diffe\-ren\-ces of two like powers could still be analyzed \cite{Nowak1998}, giving new and possibly interesting results \cite{Mostafa2005}.   },

Then we argue properties of real normed subspace. Then we discuss linear functions between real normed speces. Several kinds of subspaces induced by linear functions such as kernel, image and inverse image are considered here. The fact that Lipschitz continuity operators preserve convergence of sequences is also refered here. Then we argue the condition when real normed subspaces become Banach's spaces. We also formalize quotient vector space. In the last session, we argue the properties of the closure of real normed space.

A language is introduced with language signature including free variables, substitution, and equality. Algorithmic logic requires a bialgebra structure which is an extension of language signature and program algebra. While-if algebra of generator set and algebraic signature is bialgebra with appropriate properties and is used as basic type of algebraic logic.   },

    SUMMARY = {Almost Distributive Lattices (ADL) are structures defined by Swamy and Rao \cite{SwamyRao1981} as a common abstraction of some generalizations of the Boolean algebra. In our paper, we deal with a certain further generalization of ADLs, namely the Generalized Almost Distributive Lattices (GADL). Our main aim was to give the formal counterpart of this structure and we succeeded formalizing all items from the Section 3 of {R}ao et al.'s paper \cite{GADL:2009}. Essentially among GADLs we can find structures which are neither $\vee$-commutative nor $\wedge$-commutative (resp., $\wedge$-commutative); consequently not all forms of absorption identities hold.\par We characterized some necessary and sufficient conditions for commutativity and distributivity, we also defined the class of GADLs with zero element. We tried to use as much attributes and cluster registrations as possible, hence many identities are expressed in terms of adjectives; also some generalizations of well-known notions from lattice theory \cite{Gratzer2011} formalized within the Mizar Mathematical Library were proposed. Finally, some important examples from Rao's paper were introduced. We construct the example of GADL which is not an ADL. Mechanization of proofs in this specific area could be a good starting point towards further generalization of lattice theory \cite{Gratzer} with the help of automated theorem provers \cite{GrabMo2004}.   },

However, the definitions of forward difference, backward difference, and central difference for functions on vector spaces over $\mathbb{F}$ have not been formalized. In cryptology, these definitions are very important in evaluating the security of cryptographic systems \cite{BA1991}, \cite{Lai1994}. Differential cryptanalysis \cite{BA1993} that undertakes a general purpose attack against block ciphers \cite{DESCIP_1.ABS} can be formalized using these definitions. In this article, we formalize the definitions of forward difference, backward difference, and central difference for functions on vector spaces over $\mathbb{F}$. Moreover, we formalize some facts about these definitions.   },

    SUMMARY = {In this article, we considered bidual spaces and reflexivity of real normed spaces. At first we proved some corollaries applying Hahn-Banach theorem and showed related theorems. In the second section, we proved the norm of dual spaces and defined the natural mapping, from real normed spaces to bidual spaces. We also proved some properties of this mapping. Next, we defined real normed space of {$\mathbb R$}, real number spaces as real normed spaces and proved related theorems. We can regard linear functionals as linear operators by this definition. Accordingly we proved Uniform Boundedness Theorem for linear functionals using the theorem (5) from \cite{LOPBAN_5.ABS}. Finally, we defined reflexivity of real normed spaces and proved some theorems about isomorphism of linear operators. Using them, we proved some properties about reflexivity. These formalizations are based on \cite{ReedSimon1972}, \cite{rudin1991functional}, \cite{Dax2002} and \cite{Brezis2011}.   },

Then we define the diameter of the circumscribed circle of a triangle using the definition of the area of a triangle and prove some identities of a triangle \cite{Coxeter:1967}.

    SUMMARY = {In this article, we continue the development of the theory of fuzzy sets \cite{Zadeh:1965}, started with \cite{FUZZY_1.ABS} with the future aim to provide the formalization of fuzzy numbers \cite{DuboisPrade:1978} in terms reflecting the current state of the Mizar Mathematical Library. Note that in order to have more usable approach in \cite{FUZZY_1.ABS}, we revised that article as well; some of the ideas were described in \cite{GrabowskiFuzzy:2013}. As we can actually understand fuzzy sets just as their membership functions (via the equality of membership function and their set-theoretic counterpart), all the calculations are much simpler. To test our newly proposed approach, we give the notions of (normal) triangular and trapezoidal fuzzy sets as the examples of concrete fuzzy objects. Also $\alpha$-cuts, the core of a fuzzy set, and normalized fuzzy sets were defined. Main technical obstacle was to prove continuity of the glued maps, and in fact we did this not through its topological counterpart, but extensively reusing properties of the real line (with loss of generality of the approach, though), because we aim at formalizing fuzzy numbers in our future submissions, as well as merging with rough set approach as introduced in \cite{ROUGHS_1.ABS} and \cite{GrabowskiFI:2014}. Our base for formalization was \cite{DuboisPrade:1980} and \cite{DuboisPrade:1990}.   },

    SUMMARY = {In this article, semiring and semialgebra of sets are formalized so as to construct a measure of a given set in the next step. Although a semiring of sets has already been formalized in \cite{SRINGS_1.ABS}, that is, strictly speaking, a definition of a quasi semiring of sets suggested in the last few decades \cite{GOGUADZE:2003}. We adopt a classical definition of a semiring of sets here to avoid such a confusion. Ring of sets and algebra of sets have been formalized as non empty preboolean set \cite{FINSUB_1.ABS} and field of subsets \cite{PROB_1.ABS}, respectively. In the second section, definitions of a ring and a $\sigma$-ring of sets, which are based on a semiring and a ring of sets respectively, are formalized and their related theorems are proved. In the third section, definitions of an algebra and a $\sigma$-algebra of sets, which are based on a semialgebra and an algebra of sets respectively, are formalized and their related theorems are proved. In the last section, mutual relationships between $\sigma$-ring and $\sigma$-algebra of sets are formalized and some related examples are given. The formalization is based on \cite{GOGUADZE:2003}, and also referred to \cite{bogachev2007measure} and \cite{Halmos74}.   },

      SUMMARY = {Nelson algebras were first studied by Rasiowa and Bia\l ynicki-Birula \cite{RasiowaBirula} under the name N-lattices or quasi-pseudo-Boolean algebras. Later, in investigations by Monteiro and Brignole \cite{BrignoleI:1967, BrignoleII:1967}, and \cite{Brignole} the name ``Nelson algebras" was adopted -- which is now commonly used to show the correspondence with Nelson's paper \cite{Nelson} on constructive logic with strong negation.\par By a Nelson algebra we mean an abstract algebra $$\langle L, \top, -, \neg, \rightarrow, \Rightarrow, \sqcup, \sqcap \rangle$$ \noindent where $L$ is the carrier, $-$ is a quasi-complementation (Rasiowa used the sign $\sim$, but in Mizar ``$-$" should be used to follow the approach described in \cite{GrabMo2004} and \cite{GrabowskiJAR40}), $\neg$ is a weak pseudo-complementation, $\rightarrow$ is weak relative pseudo-complementation and $\Rightarrow$ is implicative operation. $\sqcup$ and $\sqcap$ are ordinary lattice binary operations of supremum and infimum. \par In this article we give the definition and basic properties of these algebras according to \cite{RasiowaNonClassical} and \cite{Rasiowa:2001}. We start with preliminary section on quasi-Boolean algebras (i.e. de Morgan bounded lattices). Later we give the axioms in the form of Mizar adjectives with names corresponding with those in \cite{Rasiowa:2001}. As our main result we give two axiomatizations (non-equational and equational) and the full formal proof of their equivalence. \par The second set of equations is rather long but it shows the logical essence of Nelson lattices. This formalization aims at the construction of algebraic model of rough sets \cite{GrabowskiFI:2013} in our future submissions. Section 4 contains all items from Th. 1.2 and 1.3 (and the itemization is given in the text). In the fifth section we provide full formal proof of Th. 2.1 p. 75 \cite{RasiowaNonClassical}.   },

      SUMMARY = {We translate the articles covering group theory already available in the Mizar Mathematical Library from multiplicative into additive notation. We adapt the works of Wojciech A. Trybulec \cite{GROUP_1.ABS, GROUP_2.ABS, GROUP_3.ABS} and Artur Korni{\l}owicz \cite{TOPGRP_1.ABS}. \par In particular, these authors have defined the notions of group, abelian group, power of an element of a group, order of a group and order of an element, subgroup, coset of a subgroup, index of a subgroup, conjugation, normal subgroup, topological group, dense subset and basis of a topological group. Lagrange's theorem and some other theorems concerning these notions \cite{blahut2014cryptography, inui2012group, hewitt2012abstract} are presented. \par Note that ``The term {$\mathbb Z$}-module is simply another name for an additive abelian group" \cite{NC2012}. We take an approach different than that used by Futa et al. \cite{ZMODUL01.ABS} to use in a future article the results obtained by Artur Korni{\l}owicz \cite{TOPGRP_1.ABS}. Indeed, H{\"o}lzl et al. showed that it was possible to build ``a generic theory of limits based on filters" in Isabelle/HOL \cite{holzl2013type, boldo2014formalization}. Our goal is to define the convergence of a sequence and the convergence of a series in an abelian topological group \cite{bourbaki2013general} using the notion of filters.   },

      SUMMARY = {Solving equations in integers is an important part of the number theory \cite{sierpinski1956}. In many cases it can be conducted by the factorization of equation's elements, such as the Newton's binomial. The article introduces several simple formulas, which may facilitate this process. Some of them are taken from relevant books \cite{sierpinski1950}, \cite{gancarzewicz2000}. \par In the second section of the article, Fermat's Little Theorem is proved in a classical way, on the basis of divisibility of Newton's binomial. Although slightly redundant in its content (another proof of the theorem has earlier been included in \cite{EULER_2.ABS}), the article provides a good example, how the application of registrations could shorten the length of Mizar proofs \cite{caminati2013custom}, \cite{kornilowicz2013rewriting}.   },

In the first section, we proved some topological properties of dual spaces of real normed spaces. We used these theorems for proofs of Section 3. In Section 2, we defined weak convergence and weak* convergence, and proved some properties. By \verb!RNS_Real! Mizar functor, real normed spaces as real number spaces already defined in the article \cite{DUALSP02.ABS}, we regarded sequences of real numbers as sequences of \verb!RNS_Real!. So we proved the last theorem in this section using the theorem (8) from \cite{LOPBAN_5.ABS}. In Section 3, we defined weak sequential compactness of real normed spaces. We showed some lemmas for the proof and proved the theorem of weak sequential compactness of reflexive real Banach spaces. We referred to \cite{yoshida:1980}, \cite{ReedSimon1972}, \cite{rudin1991functional} and \cite{Brezis2011} in the formalization.   },

      SUMMARY = {In this article, the orthogonal projection and the Riesz representation theorem are mainly formalized. In the first section, we defined the norm of elements on real Hilbert spaces, and defined Mizar functor \verb!RUSp2RNSp!, real normed spaces as real Hilbert spaces. By this definition, we regarded sequences of real Hilbert spaces as sequences of real normed spaces, and proved some properties of real Hilbert spaces. Furthermore, we defined the continuity and the Lipschitz the continuity of functionals on real Hilbert spaces. \par Referring to the article \cite{DUALSP01.ABS}, we also defined some definitions on real Hilbert spaces and proved some theorems for defining dual spaces of real Hilbert spaces. As to the properties of all definitions, we proved that they are equivalent properties of functionals on real normed spaces. In Sec. 2, by the definitions \cite{RUSUB_5.ABS}, we showed properties of the orthogonal complement. Then we proved theorems on the orthogonal decomposition of elements of real Hilbert spaces. They are the last two theorems of existence and uniqueness. In the third and final section, we defined the kernel of linear functionals on real Hilbert spaces. By the last three theorems, we showed the Riesz representation theorem, existence, uniqueness, and the property of the norm of bounded linear functionals on real Hilbert spaces. We referred to \cite{yoshida:1980}, \cite{Dax2002}, \cite{rudin1991functional} and \cite{Brezis2011} in the formalization.   },

However, this condition premised the existence of a $\sigma$-field and the measure on it. In general, the existence of the measure on $\sigma$-field is not obvious. On the other hand, the proof of existence of a measure on a semialgebra is easier than in the case of a $\sigma$-field. Therefore, in this article we define a measure ({\tt pre-measure}) on a semialgebra and extend it to a measure on a $\sigma$-field. Furthermore, we give a $\sigma$-measure as an extension of the measure on a $\sigma$-field. We follow \cite{Halmos74}, \cite{Bogachev2006}, and \cite{Rao2004}.   },

    SUMMARY = {Proving properties of distributed algorithms is still a highly challenging problem and various approaches that have been proposed to tackle it \cite{Abraham1999} can be roughly divided into state-based and event-based proofs. Informally speaking, state-based approaches define the behavior of a distributed algorithm as a set of sequences of memory states during its executions, while event-based approaches treat the behaviors by means of events which are produced by the executions of an algorithm. Of course, combined approaches are also possible. \par Analysis of the literature \cite{Abraham1999}, \cite{chandy1988}, \cite{Pratt1986}, \cite{lamport1986}, \cite{raynal991}, \cite{Ridge2006}, \cite{Ridge2007} shows that state-based approaches are more widely used than event-based approaches for proving properties of algorithms, and the difficulties in the event-based approach are often emphasized. We believe, however, that there is a certain naturalness and intuitive content in event-based proofs of correctness of distributed algorithms that makes this approach worthwhile. Besides, state-based proofs of correctness of distributed algorithms are usually applicable only to discrete-time models of distributed systems and cannot be easily adapted to the continuous time case which is important in the domain of cyber-physical systems. On the other hand, event-based proofs can be readily applied to continuous-time / hybrid models of distributed systems. \par In the paper \cite{AbrIvNikitch2011} we presented a compositional approach to reasoning about behavior of distributed systems in terms of events. Compositionality here means (informally) that semantics and properties of a program is determined by semantics of processes and process communication mechanisms. We demonstrated the proposed approach on a proof of the mutual exclusion property of the Peterson's algorithm \cite{Peterson1981}. We have also demonstrated an application of this approach for proving the mutual exclusion property in the setting of continuous-time models of cyber-physical systems in \cite{IvanovNikitchAbr2014}. \par Using Mizar \cite{Mizar-State-2015}, in this paper we give a formal proof of the mutual exclusion property of the Peterson's algorithm in Mizar on the basis of the event-based approach proposed in \cite{AbrIvNikitch2011}. Firstly, we define an event-based model of a shared-memory distributed system as a multi-sorted algebraic structure in which sorts are events, processes, locations (i.e. addresses in the shared memory), traces (of the system). The operations of this structure include a binary precedence relation $\leq$ on the set of events which turns it into a linear preorder (events are considered simultaneous, if ${e_1}\leq{e_2}$ and ${e_2}\leq{e_1}$), special predicates which check if an event occurs in a given process or trace, predicates which check if an event causes the system to read from or write to a given memory location, and a special partial function ``{\tt val of}" on events which gives the value associated with a memory read or write event (i.e. a value which is written or is read in this event) \cite{AbrIvNikitch2011}. Then we define several natural consistency requirements (axioms) for this structure which must hold in every distributed system, e.g. each event occurs in some process, etc. (details are given in \cite{AbrIvNikitch2011}). \par After this we formulate and prove the main theorem about the mutual exclusion property of the Peterson's algorithm in an arbitrary consistent algebraic structure of events. Informally, the main theorem states that if a system consists of two processes, and in some trace there occur two events $e_1$ and $e_2$ in different processes and each of these events is preceded by a series of three special events (in the same process) guaranteed by execution of the Peterson's algorithm (setting the flag of the current process, writing the identifier of the opposite process to the ``turn" shared variable, and reading zero from the flag of the opposite process or reading the identifier of the current process from the ``turn" variable), and moreover, if neither process writes to the flag of the opposite process or writes its own identifier to the ``turn" variable, then either the events $e_1$ and $e_2$ coincide, or they are not simultaneous (mutual exclusion property).   },

    SUMMARY = {In the article \cite{LTLAXIO1.ABS} a formal system for Propositional Linear Temporal Logic (in short LTLB) with normal semantics is introduced. The language of this logic consists of ``until" operator in a very strict version. The very strict ``until" operator enables to express all other temporal operators.\par In this article we construct a formal system for LTLB with the initial semantics \cite{KroMer}. Initial semantics means that we define the validity of the formula in a model as satisfaction in the initial state of model while normal semantics means that we define the validity as satisfaction in all states of model. We prove the Deduction Theorem, and the soundness and completeness of the introduced formal system. We also prove some theorems to compare both formal systems, i.e., the one introduced in the article \cite{LTLAXIO1.ABS} and the one introduced in this article. \par Formal systems for temporal logics are applied in the verification of computer programs. In order to carry out the verification one has to derive an appropriate formula within a selected formal system. The formal systems introduced in \cite{LTLAXIO1.ABS} and in this article can be used to carry out such verifications in Mizar \cite{Mizar-State-2015}.   },

    SUMMARY = {The article continues the formalization of the lattice theory (as structures with two binary operations, not in terms of ordering relations). In the paper, the notion of a pseudocomplement in a lattice is formally introduced in Mizar, and based on this we define the notion of the skeleton and the set of dense elements in a pseudocomplemented lattice, giving the meet-decomposition of arbitrary element of a lattice as the infimum of two elements: one belonging to the skeleton, and the other which is dense. \par The core of the paper is of course the idea of Stone identity $$a^{\star} \sqcup a^{\star\star} = \top,$$ which is fundamental for us: Stone lattices are those lattices $L$, which are distributive, bounded, and satisfy Stone identity for all elements $a\in L.$ Stone algebras were introduced by Gr\"atzer and Schmidt in \cite{Gratzer:1957}. Of course, the pseudocomplement is unique (if exists), so in a pseudcomplemented lattice we defined $a^{\star}$ as the Mizar functor (unary operation mapping every element to its pseudocomplement). In Section 2 we prove formally a collection of ordinary properties of pseudocomplemented lattices. \par All Boolean lattices are Stone, and a natural example of the lattice which is Stone, but not Boolean, is the lattice of all natural divisors of $p^2$ for arbitrary prime number $p$ (Section 6). At the end we formalize the notion of the Stone lattice $B^{[2]}$ (of pairs of elements $a,b$ of $B$ such that $a\leq b$) constructed as a sublattice of $B^2$, where $B$ is arbitrary Boolean algebra (and we describe skeleton and the set of dense elements in such lattices). In a natural way, we deal with Cartesian product of pseudocomplemented lattices. \par Our formalization was inspired by \cite{Gratzer2011}, and is an important step in formalizing Jouni J{\"a}rvinen \emph{Lattice theory for rough sets} \cite{Jarvinen:2007}, so it follows rather the latter paper. We deal essentially with Section 4.3, pages 423--426. The description of handling complemented structures in Mizar \cite{Mizar-State-2015} can be found in \cite{GrabowskiJAR40}. The current article together with \cite{NELSON_1.ABS} establishes the formal background for algebraic structures which are important for \cite{GrabowskiAssisted:2005}, \cite{GrabowskiPerspective:2007} by means of mechanisms of merging theories as described in \cite{GrabowskiFI:2014}.   },

        TITLE = {{M}odelling Real World Using Stochastic Processes and Filtration},
        AUTHOR = {Jaeger, Peter},
        ADDRESS1 = {Siegmund-Schacky-Str. 18a\\80993 Munich, Germany},
        SUMMARY = {First we give an implementation in Mizar \cite{Mizar-State-2015} basic important definitions of stochastic finance, i.e. filtration (\cite{klenke:2006}, pp. 183 and 185), adapted stochastic process (\cite{klenke:2006}, p. 185) and predictable stochastic process (\cite{follmerschied:2004}, p. 224). Second we give some concrete formalization and verification to real world examples. \par In article \cite{FINANCE2.ABS} we started to define random variables for a similar presentation to the book \cite{follmerschied:2004}. Here we continue this study. Next we define the stochastic process. For further definitions based on stochastic process we implement the definition of filtration. \par To get a better understanding we give a real world example and connect the statements to the theorems. Other similar examples are given in \cite{kremer:2006}, pp. 143--159 and in \cite{sandmann:2001}, pp. 110--124. First we introduce sets which give informations referring to today ($\Omega _{now}$, Def.6), tomorrow ($\Omega _{fut_{1}}$, Def.7) and the day after tomorrow ($\Omega _{fut_{2}}$, Def.8). We give an overview for some events in the $\sigma$-algebras $\Omega _{now} , \Omega _{fut1}$ and $\Omega _{fut2}$, see theorems (22) and (23).\par The given events are necessary for creating our next functions. The implementations take the form of: $\Omega _{now} \subset \Omega _{fut1} \subset \Omega _{fut2}$ see theorem (24). This tells us growing informations from now to the future 1$=$now, 2$=$tomorrow, 3$=$the day after tomorrow.\par We install functions $f: \lbrace 1,2,3,4 \rbrace \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ as following:\par $f_1:x \rightarrow 100, \forall x \in$ dom $f$, see theorem (36),\par $f_2:x \rightarrow 80 $, for $ x=1$ or $x=2$ and\par $f_2:x \rightarrow 120 $, for $ x=3$ or $x=4$, see theorem (37),\par $f_3:x \rightarrow 60$, for $x=1, \, f_3:x \rightarrow 80$, for $ x=2$ and\par $f_3:x \rightarrow 100$, for $ x=3, \, f_3:x \rightarrow 120$, for $ x=4$ see theorem (38).\par These functions are real random variable: $f_{1}$ over $\Omega _{now}$, $f_{2}$ over $\Omega _{fut1}$, $f_{3}$ over $\Omega _{fut2}$, see theorems (46), (43) and (40). We can prove that these functions can be used for giving an example for an adapted stochastic process. See theorem (49).\par We want to give an interpretation to these functions: suppose you have an equity $A$ which has now $(=w _{1})$ the value 100. Tomorrow $A$ changes depending which scenario occurs $-$ e.g. another marketing strategy. In scenario 1 $(=w _{11})$ it has the value 80, in scenario 2 $(=w _{12})$ it has the value 120. The day after tomorrow $A$ changes again. In scenario 1 $(=w _{111})$ it has the value 60, in scenario 2 $(=w _{112})$ the value 80, in scenario 3 $(=w _{121})$ the value 100 and in scenario 4 $(=w _{122})$ it has the value 120. For a visualization refer to the tree: \par\par {\begin{array}{lll} Now & tomorrow & the~day~after~tomorrow\\ &&w_{111}=\lbrace 1 \rbrace \\ &w_{11}=\lbrace 1,2 \rbrace \ \ \ <\\ &&w_{112}=\lbrace 2 \rbrace \\ w_{1} = \lbrace 1,2,3,4 \rbrace \ \ \ <&&\\ &&w_{121}=\lbrace 3 \rbrace \\ &w_{12}=\lbrace 3,4 \rbrace \ \ \ <\\ &&w_{122}=\lbrace 4 \rbrace \end{array}} \par\par The sets $w _{1}$,$w _{11}$,$w _{12}$,$w _{111}$,$w _{112}$,$w _{121}$,$w _{122}$ which are subsets of $\lbrace 1,2,3,4 \rbrace$, see (22), tell us which market scenario occurs. The functions tell us the values to the relevant market scenario:\par\par {\begin{array}{lll} Now & tomorrow & the~day~after~tomorrow\\ &&f_{3}(w_{i})= 60, ~w_{i} {\rm ~in~} w_{111} \\ &f_{2}(w_{i})= 80 \ \ \ <\\ &w_{i} {\rm ~in~} w_{11}&f_{3}(w_{i})= 80, ~w_{i} {\rm ~in~} w_{112} \\ f_{1}(w_{i})= 100 \ \ \ <&&\\ w_{i} {\rm ~in~} w_{1}&&f_{3}(w_{i})= 100, ~w_{i} {\rm ~in~} w_{121} \\ &f_{2}(w_{i})= 120 \ \ \ <\\ &w_{i} {\rm ~in~} w_{12}&f_{3}(w_{i})= 120, ~w_{i} {\rm ~in~} w_{122} \end{array}} \par\par For a better understanding of the definition of the random variable and the relation to the functions refer to \cite{georgii:2004}, p. 20. For the proof of certain sets as $\sigma$-fields refer to \cite{georgii:2004}, pp. 10--11 and \cite{klenke:2006}, pp. 1--2.\par This article is the next step to the {\it arbitrage opportunity}. If you use for example a simple probability measure, refer, for example to literature \cite{caratheodorycommunity:2004}, pp. 28--34, \cite{follmerschied:2004}, p. 6 and p. 232 you can calculate whether an {\it arbitrage} exists or not. Note, that the example given in literature \cite{caratheodorycommunity:2004} needs 8 instead of 4 informations as in our model. If we want to code the first 3 given time points into our model we would have the following graph, see theorems (47), (44) and (41):\par\par {\begin{array}{lll} Now & tomorrow & the~day~after~tomorrow\\ &&f_{3}(w_{i})= 180, ~w_{i} {\rm ~in~} w_{111} \\ &f_{2}(w_{i})= 150 \ \ \ <\\ &w_{i} {\rm ~in~} w_{11}&f_{3}(w_{i})= 120, ~w_{i} {\rm ~in~} w_{112} \\ f_{1}(w_{i})= 125 \ \ \ <&&\\ w_{i} {\rm ~in~} w_{1}&&f_{3}(w_{i})= 120, ~w_{i} {\rm ~in~} w_{121} \\ &f_{2}(w_{i})= 100 \ \ \ <\\ &w_{i} {\rm ~in~} w_{12}&f_{3}(w_{i})= 80, ~w_{i} {\rm ~in~} w_{122} \end{array}} \par\par The function for the ``Call-Option" is given in literature \cite{caratheodorycommunity:2004}, p. 28. The function is realized in Def.5. As a background, more examples for using the definition of filtration are given in \cite{klenke:2006}, pp. 185--188.   },

The extended law of sines and the formula of the radius of the Morley's trisector triangle are formalized \cite{Coxeter:1967}. \par Using the generalized Ceva's Theorem, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the centroid (the common point of the medians \cite{hartshorne2000geometry}) of a triangle.   },

            complete metric space" (version 1. with the results obtained in \cite{REAL_NS1.ABS}, \cite{RSSPACE3.ABS}, 
            \cite{LOPBAN_1.ABS} and version 2., the results obtained in \cite{REAL_NS1.ABS}, \cite{NORMSP_2.ABS}, 
            (\textit{registrations}) \cite{LOPBAN_5.ABS}). \par With the Cantor's theorem - in complete metric space 
            (proof by Karol P\k{a}k in \cite{COMPL_SP.ABS}), we formalize ``The Nested Intervals Theorem in 
            1-dimensional Euclidean metric space". \par Pierre Cousin's proof in 1892 \cite{Maurey2005} the lemma, 
            published in 1895 \cite{Cousin1895} states that: \begin{quote} ``Soit, sur le plan YOX, une aire 
            connexe $S$ limit\'ee par un contour ferm\'e simple ou complexe; on suppose qu'\`a chaque point 
            de $S$ ou de son p\'erim\`etre correspond un cercle, de rayon non nul, ayant ce point pour centre : 
            il est alors toujours possible de subdiviser $S$ en r\'egions, en nombre fini et assez petites pour 
            que chacune d'elles soit compl\'etement int\'erieure au cercle correspondant \`a un point convenablement 
            choisi dans $S$ ou sur son p\'erim\`etre." \end{quote} (In the plane YOX let $S$ be a connected area 
            bounded by a closed contour, simple or complex; one supposes that at each point of $S$ or its perimeter 
            there is a circle, of non-zero radius, having this point as its centre; it is then always possible to 
            subdivide $S$ into regions, finite in number and sufficiently small for each one of them to be entirely 
            inside a circle corresponding to a suitably chosen point in $S$ or on its perimeter) \cite{Raman2015}. \par 
            Cousin's Lemma, used in Henstock and Kurzweil integral \cite{yee2000integral} (generalized Riemann integral), 
            state that: ``for any gauge $\delta$, there exists at least one $\delta$-fine tagged partition". 
            In the last section, we formalize this theorem. We use the suggestions given to the Cousin's Theorem

            SUMMARY = {Rough sets, developed by Zdzis{\l}aw Pawlak \cite{Pawlak1982}, are an important tool to describe the state of incomplete or partially unknown information. In this article, which is essentially the continuation of \cite{ROUGHS_2.ABS}, we try to give the characterization of approximation operators in terms of ordinary properties of underlying relations (some of them, as serial and mediate relations, were not available in the Mizar Mathematical Library \cite{FourDecades}). Here we drop the classical equivalence- and tolerance-based models of rough sets trying to formalize some parts of \cite{Zhu:2007}. \par The main aim of this Mizar article is to provide a formal counterpart for the rest of the paper of William Zhu \cite{Zhu:2007}. In order to do this, we recall also Theorem~3 from Y.Y. Yao's paper \cite{Yao96}. The first part of our formalization (covering first seven pages) is contained in \cite{ROUGHS_2.ABS}. Now we start from page 5003, sec. 3.4. \cite{Zhu:2007}. We formalized almost all numbered items (definitions, propositions, theorems, and corollaries), with the exception of Proposition 7, where we stated our theorem only in terms of singletons. We provided more thorough discussion of the property {\em positive alliance} and its connection with seriality and reflexivity (and also transitivity). Examples were not covered as a rule as we tried to construct a~more general mechanism of finding appropriate models for approximation spaces in Mizar providing more automatization than it is now \cite{GrabowskiPerspective:2007}. \par Of course, we can see some more general applications of some registrations of clusters, essentially not dealing with the notion of an approximation: the notions of an alliance binary relation were not defined in the Mizar Mathematical Library before, and we should think about other properties which are also absent but needed in the context of rough approximations \cite{GrabowskiJ10}, \cite{GrabowskiAssisted:2005}. Via theory merging, using mechanisms described in \cite{GrabowskiFI:2014} and \cite{GrabowskiJAR40}, such elementary constructions can be extended to other frameworks.   },

            SUMMARY = {In our earlier article \cite{GTARSKI1.ABS}, the first part of axioms of geometry proposed by Alfred Tarski \cite{TarskiGivant} was formally introduced by means of Mizar proof assistant \cite{FourDecades}. We defined a structure \verb!TarskiPlane! with the following predicates: \begin{itemize} \item of betweenness \verb!between! (a ternary relation), \item of congruence of segments \verb!equiv! (quarternary relation), \end{itemize} \noindent which satisfy the following properties: \begin{itemize} \item congruence symmetry (A1), \item congruence equivalence relation (A2), \item congruence identity (A3), \item segment construction (A4), \item SAS (A5), \item betweenness identity (A6), \item Pasch (A7). \end{itemize} Also a simple model, which satisfies these axioms, was previously constructed, and described in \cite{GrabowskiFed2016}. In this paper, we deal with four remaining axioms, namely: \begin{itemize} \item the lower dimension axiom (A8), \item the upper dimension axiom (A9), \item the Euclid axiom (A10), \item the continuity axiom (A11). \end{itemize} They were introduced in the form of Mizar attributes. Additionally, the relation of congruence of triangles \verb!cong! is introduced via congruence of sides (SSS). \par In order to show that the structure which satisfies all eleven Tarski's axioms really exists, we provided a proof of the registration of a cluster that the Euclidean plane, or rather a natural \cite{GrabowskiFI:2014} extension of ordinary metric structure \verb!Euclid 2! satisfies all these attributes. \par Although the tradition of the mechanization of Tarski's geometry in Mizar is not as long as in Coq \cite{Narboux:2007}, first approaches to this topic were done in Mizar in 1990 \cite{INCSP_1.ABS} (even if this article started formal Hilbert axiomatization of geometry, and parallel development was rather unlikely at that time \cite{GrabowskiDuplication}). Connection with another proof assistant should be mentioned -- we had some doubts about the proof of the Euclid's axiom and inspection of the proof taken from Archive of Formal Proofs of Isabelle \cite{Makarios} clarified things a bit. Our development allows for the future faithful mechanization of \cite{Schwabhauser:1983} and opens the possibility of automatically generated Prover9 proofs which was useful in the case of lattice theory \cite{GrabowskiJAR40}.   },

In the first section, we formalized general topological properties of metric spaces. We discussed openness and closedness of subsets in metric spaces in terms of convergence of element sequences. In the second section, we firstly formalize the definition of sequentially compact, and then discuss the equivalence of compactness, countable compactness, sequential compactness, and totally boundedness with completeness in metric spaces. \par In the third section, we discuss compactness in norm spaces. We formalize the equivalence of compactness and sequential compactness in norm space. In the fourth section, we formalize topological properties of the real line in terms of convergence of real number sequences. In the last section, we formalize the equivalence of compactness and sequential compactness in the real line. These formalizations are based on \cite{yoshida:1980}, \cite{bourbaki1987elements}, \cite{rudin1991functional}, \cite{Kreyszig1989}, and \cite{bourbaki2013general}.   },

      SUMMARY = {First, we define in Mizar \cite{Mizar-State-2015}, the Cartesian product of two filters bases and the Cartesian product of two filters. After comparing the product of two Fr{\'e}chet filters on $\mathbb N$ (${\cal F}_1$) with the Fr{\'e}chet filter on $\mathbb N\times \mathbb N$ (${\cal F}_2$), we compare $lim_{{\cal F}_1}$ and $lim_{{\cal F}_2}$ for all double sequences in a non empty topological space. \par Endou, Okazaki and Shidama formalized in \cite{DBLSEQ_1.ABS} the ``convergence in Pringsheim's sense'' for double sequence of real numbers. We show some basic correspondences between the $p$-convergence and the filter convergence in a topological space. Then we formalize that the double sequence $(x_{m,n}=\frac{1}{m+1})_{(m,n)}\in{\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}}$ converges in ``Pringsheim's sense" but not in Frechet filter on $\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}$ sense. \par In the next section, we generalize some definitions: ``is convergent in the first coordinate", ``is convergent in the second coordinate", ``the $lim$ in the first coordinate of", ``the $lim$ in the second coordinate of" according to \cite{DBLSEQ_1.ABS}, in Hausdorff space. \par Finally, we generalize two theorems: (3) and (4) from \cite{DBLSEQ_1.ABS} in the case of double sequences and we formalize the ``iterated limit" theorem (``Double limit" \cite{bourbaki2013general}, p. 81, par. 8.5 \textit{``Double limite"} \cite{bourbaki2007topologie} (TG I,57)), all in regular space. We were inspired by the exercises (2.11.4), (2.17.5) \cite{wagschal} and the corrections B.10 \cite{wagschaltopex}.   },

      SUMMARY = {While discussing the sum of consecutive powers as a result of division of two binomials W.W. Sawyer \cite{sawyer1970} observes \begin{quote} ``It is a curious fact that most algebra textbooks give our ast result twice. It appears in two different chapters and usually there is no mention in either of these that it also occurs in the other. The first chapter, of course, is that on factors. The second is that on geometrical progressions. Geometrical progressions are involved in nearly all financial questions involving compound interest -- mortgages, annuities, etc." \end{quote} It's worth noticing that the first issue involves a simple arithmetical division of 99...9 by 9. While the above notion seems not have changed over the last 50 years, it reflects only a special case of a broader class of problems involving two variables. It seems strange, that while binomial formula is discussed and studied widely \cite{CAO201096}, \cite{KHANDUJA2011300}, little research is done on its counterpart with all coefficients equal to one, which we will call here the subnomial. The study focuses on its basic properties and applies it to some simple problems usually proven by~induction~\cite{gancarzewicz2000}.   },

      SUMMARY = {This article introduces propositional logic as a formal system (\cite{AniWas}, \cite{wp1992}, \cite{wp1994}). The formulae of the language are as follows $\phi::=\,\,\perp|\, p\,|\,\phi\rightarrow\phi$. Other connectives are introduced as abbrevations. The notions of model and satisfaction in model are defined. The axioms are all the formulae of the following schemes \begin{itemize} \item $\alpha\Rightarrow(\beta\Rightarrow\alpha)$, \item $(\alpha\Rightarrow(\beta\Rightarrow\gamma))\Rightarrow((\alpha\Rightarrow\beta)\Rightarrow (\alpha\Rightarrow\gamma))$, \item $(\neg\beta\Rightarrow\neg\alpha)\Rightarrow ((\neg\beta\Rightarrow\alpha)\Rightarrow\beta)$. \end{itemize} Modus ponens is the only derivation rule. The soundness theorem and the strong completeness theorem are proved. The proof of the completeness theorem is carried out by a counter-model existence method. In order to prove the completeness theorem, Lindenbaum's Lemma is proved. Some most widely used tautologies are presented.   },

      SUMMARY = {This article formalizes the proof of Niven's theorem \cite{Niven1956} which states that if $x/\pi$ and $sin(x)$ are both rational, then the sine takes values $0$, $\pm 1/2$, and $\pm 1$. The main part of the formalization follows the informal proof presented at Pr$\infty$fWiki (\url{https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Niven's_Theorem#Source_of_Name}). For this proof, we have also formalized the rational and integral root theorems setting constraints on solutions of polynomial equations with integer coefficients \cite{king2006, SLang}.   },

Some theorems have the possibility of slight generalization, but we have priority to avoid the complexity of the description. First of all, for the product measure constructed in \cite{MEASUR10.ABS}, we show some theorems. Then we introduce the section which plays an important role in Fubini's theorem, and prove the relevant proposition. Finally we show Fubini's theorem on measure.   },

      SUMMARY = {The article defines Liouville numbers, originally introduced by Joseph Liouville in 1844 \cite{Liouville1844} as an example of an object which can be approximated ``quite closely" by a sequence of rational numbers. A real number $x$ is a Liouville number iff for every positive integer $n$, there exist integers $p$ and $q$ such that $q> 1$ and $$0< \left|x - \frac{p}{q}\right|<\frac{1}{q^n}.$$ It is easy to show that all Liouville numbers are irrational. Liouville constant, which is also defined formally, is the first transcendental (not algebraic) number. It is defined in Section 6 quite generally as the sum $$\sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{a_k}{b^{k!}}$$ \noindent for a finite sequence $\{a_k\}_{k\in {\mathbb N}}$ and $b \in {\mathbb N}$. Based on this definition, we also introduced the so-called Liouville number as $$L = \sum\limits_{k=1}^{\infty} 10^{-k!} = 0.110001000000000000000001 \dots,$$ substituting in the definition of $L(a_k,b)$ the constant sequence of 1's and $b = 10$. Another important examples of transcendental numbers are $e$ and $\pi$ \cite{Bingham:2011}, \cite{Eberl-AFP:2015}, \cite{Bernard:2016}. At the end, we show that the construction of an arbitrary Lioville constant satisfies the properties of a Liouville number \cite{Conway:1996}, \cite{Apostol:1997}. We show additionally, that the set of all Liouville numbers is infinite, opening the next item from Abad and Abad's list of ``Top 100 Theorems". We show also some preliminary constructions linking real sequences and finite sequences, where summing formulas are involved. In the Mizar \cite{FourDecades} proof, we follow closely \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liouville_number}. The aim is to show that all Liouville numbers are transcendental.   },

      SUMMARY = {In this Mizar article, we complete the formalization of one of the items from Abad and Abad's challenge list of ``Top 100 Theorems" about Liouville numbers and the existence of transcendental numbers. It is item {\tt{\#18}} from the ``Formalizing 100 Theorems" list maintained by Freek Wiedijk at \url{http://www.cs.ru.nl/F.Wiedijk/100/}. Liouville numbers were introduced by Joseph Liouville in 1844 \cite{Liouville1844} as an example of an object which can be approximated ``quite closely" by a sequence of rational numbers. A real number $x$ is a Liouville number iff for every positive integer $n$, there exist integers $p$ and $q$ such that $q > 1$ and $$0< \left|x - \frac{p}{q}\right|<\frac{1}{q^n}.$$ It is easy to show that all Liouville numbers are irrational. The definition and basic notions are contained in \cite{Conway:1996}, \cite{Apostol:1997}, and \cite{LIOUVIL1.ABS}. Liouvile constant, which is defined formally in \cite{LIOUVIL1.ABS}, is the first explicit transcendental (not algebraic) number, another notable examples are $e$ and $\pi$ \cite{Bingham:2011}, \cite{Eberl-AFP:2015}, and \cite{Bernard:2016}. Algebraic numbers were formalized with the help of the Mizar system \cite{FourDecades} very recently, by Yasushige Watase in \cite{ALGNUM_1.ABS} and now we expand these techniques into the area of not only pure algebraic domains (as fields, rings and formal polynomials), but also for more set-theoretic fields. Finally we show that all Liouville numbers are transcendental, based on Liouville's theorem on Diophantine approximation.   },

      SUMMARY = {Using the Mizar system \cite{Mizar-State-2015}, we formalized that homographies of the projective real plane (as defined in \cite{ANPROJ_8.ABS}), form a group. \par Then, we prove that, using the notations of Borsuk and Szmielew in \cite{BORSUK:1} \begin{quote} ``Consider in space $\mathbb{RP}^2$ points $P_1,P_2,P_3,P_4$ of which three points are not collinear and points $Q_1,Q_2,Q_3,Q_4$ each three points of which are also not collinear. There exists one homography $h$ of space $\mathbb{RP}^2$ such that $h(P_i)=Q_i$ for $i = 1,2,3,4$." \end{quote} (Existence Statement 52 and Existence Statement 53) \cite{BORSUK:1}. Or, using notations of Richter \cite{richter2011perspectives} \begin{quote} ``Let $[a]$, $[b]$, $[c]$, $[d]$ in $\mathbb{RP}^2$ be four points of which no three are collinear and let $[a']$,$[b']$,$[c']$,$[d']$ in $\mathbb{RP}^2$ be another four points of which no three are collinear, then there exists a $3\times 3$ matrix $M$ such that $[Ma] = [a']$, $[Mb] = [b']$, $[Mc]$ = $[c']$, and $[Md] = [d']$" \end{quote} Makarios has formalized the same results in Isabelle/Isar (the collineations form a group, lemma statement52-existence and lemma statement 53-existence) and published it in Archive of Formal Proofs\footnote{\url{http://isa-afp.org/entries/Tarskis_Geometry.shtml}} \cite{makarios}, \cite{Tarskis_Geometry-AFP}.   },

    SUMMARY = {In the article we present in the Mizar system \cite{Mizar-State-2015}, \cite{FourDecades} the catalogue of triangular norms and conorms, used especially in the theory of fuzzy sets \cite{Zadeh:1965}. The name \emph{triangular} emphasizes the fact that in the framework of probabilistic metric spaces they generalize triangle inequality \cite{DuboisPrade:1980}.\par After defining corresponding Mizar mode using four attributes, we introduced the following t-norms: \begin{itemize} \item minimum t-norm \verb!minnorm! (Def.~6), \item product t-norm \verb!prodnorm! (Def.~8), \item \L ukasiewicz t-norm \verb!Lukasiewicz_norm! (Def.~10), \item drastic t-norm \verb!drastic_norm! (Def.~11), \item nilpotent minimum \verb!nilmin_norm! (Def.~12), \item Hamacher product \verb!Hamacher_norm! (Def.~13), \end{itemize} and corresponding t-conorms: \begin{itemize} \item maximum t-conorm \verb!maxnorm! (Def.~7), \item probabilistic sum \verb!probsum_conorm! (Def.~9), \item bounded sum \verb!BoundedSum_conorm! (Def.~19), \item drastic t-conorm \verb!drastic_conorm! (Def.~14), \item nilpotent maximum \verb!nilmax_conorm! (Def.~18), \item Hamacher t-conorm \verb!Hamacher_conorm! (Def.~17). \end{itemize} Their basic properties and duality are shown; we also proved the predicate of the ordering of norms \cite{Klement:2000}, \cite{Hajek:1998}. It was proven formally that drastic-norm is the pointwise smallest t-norm and minnorm is the pointwise largest t-norm (maxnorm is the pointwise smallest t-conorm and drastic-conorm is the pointwise largest t-conorm). \par This work is a continuation of the development of fuzzy sets in Mizar \cite{GrabowskiFuzzy:2013} started in \cite{FUZZY_1.ABS} and \cite{FUZNUM_1.ABS}; it could be used to give a variety of more general operations on fuzzy sets. Our formalization is much closer to the set theory used within the Mizar Mathematical Library than the development of rough sets \cite{GrabowskiAssisted:2005}, the approach which was chosen allows however for merging both theories \cite{GrabowskiFI:2014}, \cite{GrabowskiMitsuishi:2015}.   },

    TITLE = {{I}ntroduction to Stopping Time in Stochastic Finance Theory},
    AUTHOR = {Jaeger, Peter},
    ADDRESS1 = {Siegmund-Schacky-Str. 18a\\80993 Munich, Germany},
    SUMMARY = { We start with the definition of stopping time according to \cite{follmerschied:2004}, p.283. We prove, that different definitions for stopping time can coincide. We give examples of stopping time using constant-functions or functions defined with the operator max or min (defined in \cite{klenke:2006}, pp.37--38). Finally we give an example with some given filtration. Stopping time is very important for stochastic finance. A stopping time is the moment, where a certain event occurs (\cite{kremer:2006}, p.372) and can be used together with stochastic processes (\cite{follmerschied:2004}, p.283). Look at the following example: we install a function ST: \{1,2,3,4\} \to \{0,1,2\} \ $\cup$ \{+$\infty$\}, we define:\par a. ST(1)=1, ST(2)=1, ST(3)=2, ST(4)=2.\par b. The set \{0,1,2\} consists of time points: 0=now,1=tomorrow,2=the day after tomorrow.\par We can prove:\par c. \{w, where w is Element of $\Omega$: ST.w=0\}=$\emptyset$ \& \{w, where w is Element of $\Omega$: ST.w=1\}=\{1,2\} \& \{w, where w is Element of $\Omega$: ST.w=2\}=\{3,4\} and\par ST is a stopping time.\par We use a function Filt as Filtration of \{0,1,2\}, $\Sigma$ where Filt(0)=$\Omega_{now}$, Filt(1)=$\Omega_{fut1}$ and Filt(2)=$\Omega_{fut2}$. From a.,b. and c. we know that:\par d. \{w, where w is Element of $\Omega$: ST.w=0\} in $\Omega_{now}$ and\par \{w, where w is Element of $\Omega$: ST.w=1\} in $\Omega_{fut1}$ and\par \{w, where w is Element of $\Omega$: ST.w=2\} in $\Omega_{fut2}$.\par The sets in d. are events, which occur at the time points 0(=now), 1(=tomorrow) or 2(=the day after tomorrow), see also \cite{kremer:2006}, p.371. Suppose we have ST(1)=$+\infty$, then this means that for 1 the corresponding event never occurs.\par As an interpretation for our installed functions consider the given adapted stochastic process in the article \cite{FINANCE3.ABS}.\par ST(1)=1 means, that the given element 1 in \{1,2,3,4\} is stopped in 1 (=tomorrow). That tells us, that we have to look at the value $f_{2}(1)$ which is equal to 80. The same argumentation can be applied for the element 2 in \{1,2,3,4\}.\par ST(3)=2 means, that the given element 3 in \{1,2,3,4\} is stopped in 2 (=the day after tomorrow). That tells us, that we have to look at the value $f_{3}(3)$ which is equal to 100.\par ST(4)=2 means, that the given element 4 in \{1,2,3,4\} is stopped in 2 (=the day after tomorrow). That tells us, that we have to look at the value $f_{3}(4)$ which is equal to 120.\par In the real world, these functions can be used for questions like: when does the share price exceed a certain limit? (see \cite{kremer:2006}, p.372).   },

    SUMMARY = {In this article we check, with the Mizar system \cite{Mizar-State-2015}, Pascal's theorem in the real projective plane (in projective geometry Pascal's theorem is also known as the Hexagrammum Mysticum Theorem)\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal's\_theorem}}. Pappus' theorem is a special case of a degenerate conic of two lines.\par For proving Pascal's theorem, we use the techniques developed in the section ``Projective Proofs of Pappus' Theorem" in the chapter ``Pappus' Theorem: Nine proofs and three variations" \cite{Richter-Gebert2011}. We also follow some ideas from Harrison's work. With HOL Light, he has the proof of Pascal's theorem\footnote{\url{https://github.com/jrh13/hol-light/tree/master/100/pascal.ml}}. For a lemma, we use { \verb PROVER9 }\footnote{\url{https://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/prover9/ }} and { \verb OTT2MIZ } by Josef Urban\footnote{\url{https://github.com/JUrban/ott2miz}} \cite{rudnicki2011escape, grabowski2006solving, grabowskiJAR40}.

    SUMMARY = { In preparation for the formalization in Mizar \cite{Mizar-State-2015} of lotteries as given in \cite{MSZ}, this article closes some gaps in the Mizar Mathematical Library (MML) regarding relational structures. The quotient order is introduced by the equivalence relation identifying two elements $x, y$ of a preorder as equivalent if $x \leqslant y$ and $y \leqslant x$. This concept is known (see e.g. chapter 5 of \cite{OSI}) and was first introduced into the MML in \cite{DICKSON.ABS} and that work is incorporated here. Furthermore given a set $A$, partition $D$ of $A$ and a finite-support function $f:A\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, a function $\Sigma_f : D \rightarrow\mathbb{R}, \Sigma_f (X) = \sum_{x\in X} f(x)$ can be defined as some kind of natural ``restriction" from $f$ to $D$. The first main result of this article can then be formulated as: \[\sum_{x\in A} f(x) = \sum_{X\in D}\Sigma_f (X) \left(= \sum_{X\in D}\sum_{x\in X} f(x)\right)\] After that (weakly) ascending/descending finite sequences (based on \cite{FINSEQ_1.ABS}) are introduced, in analogous notation to their infinite counterparts introduced in \cite{WELLFND1.ABS} and \cite{DICKSON.ABS}.\par The second main result is that any finite subset of any transitive connected relational structure can be sorted as a ascending or descending finite sequence, thus generalizing the results from \cite{RFINSEQ2.ABS}, where finite sequence of real numbers were sorted.\par The third main result of the article is that any weakly ascending/weakly descending finite sequence on elements of a preorder induces a weakly ascending/weakly descending finite sequence on the projection of these elements into the quotient order. Furthermore, weakly ascending finite sequences can be interpreted as directed walks in a directed graph, when the set of edges is described by ordered pairs of vertices, which is quite common (see e.g. \cite{IAlg}).\par Additionally, some auxiliary theorems are provided, e.g. two schemes to find the smallest or the largest element in a finite subset of a connected transitive relational structure with a given property and a lemma I found rather useful: Given two finite one-to-one sequences $s, t$ on a set $X$, such that $\rng t \subseteq \rng s$, and a function $f:X\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ such that $f$ is zero for every $x\in\rng s\setminus\rng t$, we have $\sum f\circ s = \sum f\circ t$.   },

In the first section, we defined Mizar functor \verb!ClstoCmp!, compact topological spaces as closed interval subset of real numbers. Then using the former definition and referring to the article \cite{C0SP1.ABS} and the article \cite{C0SP2.ABS}, we defined the normed spaces of continuous functions on closed interval subset of real numbers, and defined the normed spaces of bounded functions on closed interval subset of real numbers. We also proved some related properties. \par In Sec.2, we proved some lemmas for the proof of F. Riesz theorem. In Sec.3, we proved F. Riesz theorem, about the dual space of the space of continuous functions on closed interval subset of real numbers, finally. We applied Hahn-Banach theorem (36) in \cite{DUALSP01.ABS}, to the proof of the last theorem. For the description of theorems of this section, we also referred to the article \cite{INTEGR22.ABS} and the article \cite{INTEGR23.ABS}. These formalizations are based on \cite{Brezis2011}, \cite{Dax2002}, \cite{rudin1991functional}, and \cite{yoshida:1980}.   },

      SUMMARY = {In this paper we give a~formal definition of the notion of nominative data with simple names and complex values \cite{Nikitch98,Nikitch2001,Skobelev2014} and formal definitions of the basic operations on such data, including naming, denaming and overlapping, following the work \cite{Skobelev2014}. \par The notion of nominative data plays an important role in the composition-nominative approach to program formalization \cite{Nikitch98,Nikitch2001} which is a~development of composition programming \cite{Redko1979}. Both approaches are compared in \cite{Nikitch2009}. \par The composition-nominative approach considers mathematical models of computer software and data on various levels of abstraction and generality and provides mathematical tools for reasoning about their properties. In particular, nominative data are mathematical models of data which are stored and processed in computer systems. The composition-nominative approach considers different types \cite{Nikitch2009,Skobelev2014} of nominative data, but all of them are based on the name-value relation. One powerful type of nominative data, which is suitable for representing many kinds of data commonly used in programming like lists, multidimensional arrays, trees, tables, etc. is the type of nominative data with simple (abstract) names and complex (structured) values. The set of nominative data of given type together with a~number of basic operations on them like naming, denaming and overlapping \cite{Skobelev2014} form an algebra which is called {\em data algebra}. \par In the composition-nominative approach computer programs which process data are modeled as partial functions which map nominative data from the carrier of a~given data algebra (input data) to nominative data (output data). Such functions are also called {\em binominative functions}. Programs which evaluate conditions are modeled as partial predicates on nominative data (nominative predicates). Programming language constructs like sequential execution, branching, cycle, etc. which construct programs from the existing programs are modeled as operations which take binominative functions and predicates and produce binominative functions. Such operations are called {\em compositions}. A~set of binominative functions and a~set of predicates together with appropriate compositions form an algebra which is called {\em program algebra}. This algebra serves as a~semantic model of a~programming language. \par For functions over nominative data a~special computability called abstract computability is introduces and complete classes of computable functions are specified \cite{Nikitch2001}. \par For reasoning about properties of programs modeled as binominative functions a~Floyd-Hoare style logic \cite{Floyd1967,Hoare1969} is introduced and applied \cite{Kryvolap2013,NikitchKryvolap2013,DBLP:journals/csjm/IvanovNS16,KornilowiczetalICTERI2017,DBLP:conf/fedcsis/KornilowiczKNI17, DBLP:conf/isat/KornilowiczKNI17}. One advantage of this approach to reasoning about programs is that it naturally handles programs which process complex data structures (which can be quite straightforwardly represented as nominative data). Also, unlike classical Floyd-Hoare logic, the mentioned logic allows reasoning about assertions which include partial pre- and post-conditions \cite{KornilowiczetalICTERI2017}. \par Besides modeling data processed by programs, nominative data can be also applied to modeling data processed by signal processing systems in the context of the mathematical systems theory \cite{Ivanov2014,IvanovNikitchAbr2014,DBLP:journals/fm/IvanovNA15,Ivanov2016,DBLP:journals/corr/Ivanov17}.   },

    ADDRESS1 = {Rue de la Brasserie 5\\7100 La Louvi\`ere, Belgium},
      SUMMARY = {Some authors have formalized the integral in the Mizar Mathematical Library (MML). The first article in a series on the Darboux/Riemann integral was written by Noboru Endou and Artur Korni{\l}owicz: \cite{INTEGRA1.ABS}. The Lebesgue integral was formalized a little later \cite{shidama2007formalization} and recently the integral of Riemann-Stieltjes was introduced in the MML by Keiko Narita, Kazuhisa Nakasho and Yasunari Shidama \cite{INTEGR22.ABS}.\par A presentation of definitions of integrals in other proof assistants or proof checkers (ACL2, COQ, Isabelle/HOL, HOL4, HOL Light, PVS, ProofPower) may be found in \cite{harrison2007formalizing} and \cite{boldo2016formalization}.\par Using the Mizar system \cite{Mizar-State-2015}, we define the Gauge integral (Henstock-Kurzweil) of a real-valued function on a real interval $\lbrack a,b \rbrack$ (see \cite{bartle1996return}, \cite{bartle2001modern}, \cite{yee2000integral}, \cite{peng2008integral}, \cite{mawhin2001eternel}). In the next section we formalize that the Henstock-Kurzweil integral is linear.\par In the last section, we verified that a real-valued bounded integrable (in sense Darboux/Riemann \cite{INTEGRA1.ABS,INTEGRA3.ABS,INTEGRA4.ABS}) function over a interval $\[a,b\]$ is Gauge integrable.\par Note that, in accordance with the possibilities of the MML \cite{grabowski2007revisions}, we reuse a large part of demonstrations already present in another article. Instead of rewriting the proof already contained in \cite{INTEGRA3.ABS} (MML Version: 5.42.1290), we slightly modified this article in order to use directly the expected results.   },

        AUTHOR = {Jaeger, Peter},
        ADDRESS1 = {Siegmund-Schacky-Str. 18a\\80993 Munich, Germany},
          SUMMARY = {We start proceeding with the stopping time theory in discrete time with the help of the Mizar system \cite{Mizar-State-2015}, \cite{FourDecades}. We prove, that the expression for two stopping times $k_{1}$ and $k_{2}$ not always implies a stopping time $(k_{1}+k_{2})$ (see Theorem 6 in this paper). If you want to get a stopping time, you have to cut the function e.g. $(k_{1}+k_{2}) \cap T $ (see \cite[p.~283 Remark 6.14]{follmerschied:2004}). \par Next we introduce the stopping time in continuous time. We are focused on the intervals $[0,r]$ where $r \in \mathbb{R}$. We prove, that for $I = [0,r]$ or $I=[0,+\infty[$ the set $\{ A \cap I: A \in \mathop{\rm Borel\hbox{-}Sets} \}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra of $I$ (see Definition 6 in this paper, and more general given in \cite[p.12 1.8e]{georgii:2004}). The interval $I$ can be considered as a timeline from now to some point in the future. \par This set is necessary to define our next lemma. We prove the existence of the $\sigma$-algebra of the $\tau$-past, where $\tau$ is a stopping time (see Definition 11 in this paper and \cite[p.187, Definition 9.19]{klenke:2006}). If $\tau_{1}$ and $\tau_{2}$ are stopping times with $\tau_{1}$ is smaller or equal than $\tau_{2}$ we can prove, that the $\sigma$-algebra of the $\tau_{1}$-past is a subset of the $\sigma$-algebra of the $\tau_{2}$-past (see Theorem 9 in this paper and \cite[p.187 Lemma 9.21]{klenke:2006}). \par Suppose, that you want to use Lemma 9.21 with some events, that never occur, see as a comparison the paper \cite{FINANCE4.ABS} and the example for ST(1)=$\{ + \infty \}$ in the Summary. We don't have the element $+\infty$ in our above-mentioned time intervals $[0,r[$ and [0,$+\infty$[. This is only possible if we construct a new $\sigma$-algebra on $\mathbb{R} \cup \{-\infty,+\infty\}$. This construction is similar to the Borel-Sets and we call this $\sigma$-algebra extended Borel sets (see Definition 13 in this paper and \cite[p.~21]{georgii:2004}). It can be proved, that $\{ +\infty \}$ is an Element of extended Borel sets (see Theorem 21 in this paper). Now we use the interval $[0,+\infty]$ as a basis. We construct a $\sigma$-algebra on $[0,+\infty]$ similar to the book (\cite[p.~12 18e]{georgii:2004}), see Definition 18 in this paper, and call it extended Borel subsets. We prove for stopping times with this given $\sigma$-algebra, that for $\tau_{1}$ and $\tau_{2}$ are stopping times with $\tau_{1}$ is smaller or equal than $\tau_{2}$ we have the $\sigma$-algebra of the $\tau_{1}$-past is a subset of the $\sigma$-algebra of the $\tau_{2}$-past, see Theorem 25 in this paper. It is obvious, that $\{ +\infty \} \in$ extended Borel subsets. \par In general, Lemma 9.21 is important for the proof of the Optional Sampling Theorem, see 10.11 Proof of (i) in \cite[p.~203]{klenke:2006}.   },

Both theorems are well explained as a basic result of the theory of Diophantine approximations appeared in \cite{HardyWright:2008}, \cite{NIVEN:2008}. \par A formal proof of Dirichlet's theorem, namely an inequation $| \theta - y/x | \leq 1/x^2$ has infinitely many integer solutions $(x,y)$ where $\theta$ is an irrational number, was given in \cite{DIOPHAN1.ABS}. A finer approximation is given by Hurwitz' theorem: $| \theta - y/x | \leq 1/\sqrt5 x^2$ .\par Minkowski's theorem concerns an inequation of a product of non-homogeneous binary linear forms such that $| a_1 x + b_1 y + c_1 |\cdot | a_2 x + b_2 y + c_2 | \leq \Delta/4$ where $\Delta = |a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1| \neq 0$, has at least one integer solution.   },

After we prepared some introductory formal framework in our two previous Mizar articles, we focus on the regular translation of underlying items faithfully following the abovementioned book (our encoding covers first seven chapters). Our development utilizes also other formalization efforts of the same topic, e.g. Isabelle/HOL by Makarios, Metamath or even proof objects obtained directly from Prover9. \par In addition, using the native Mizar constructions (cluster registrations) the propositions (``Satz") are reformulated under weaker conditions, i.e. by using fewer axioms or by proposing an alternative version that uses just another axioms (ex. Satz 2.1 or Satz 2.2).   },

    AUTHOR = {Jaeger, Peter},
    ADDRESS1 = {Siegmund-Schacky-Str. 18a\\80993 Munich, Germany},
    SUMMARY = {Using the Mizar system \cite{Mizar-State-2015}, \cite{FourDecades}, we start to show, that the Call-Option, the Put-Option and the Straddle (more generally defined as in the literature) are random variables (\cite{follmerschied:2004}, p.~15), see (Def.~\hyperlink{def:1}{1}) and (Def.~\hyperlink{def:2}{2}). Next we construct and prove the simple random variables (\cite{heinz:2002}, p.~14) in (Def.~\hyperlink{def:8}{8}). \par In the third section, we introduce the definition of arbitrage opportunity, see (Def.~\hyperlink{def:12}{12}). Next we show, that this definition can be characterized in a different way (Lemma 1.3. in \cite{follmerschied:2004}, p.~5), see (\hyperlink{th:17}{17}). In our formalization for Lemma 1.3 we make the assumption that $\varphi$ is a sequence of real numbers (there are only finitely many valued of interest, the values of $\varphi$ in $R^d$). For the definition of almost sure with probability 1 see p.~6 in \cite{heinz:2002}. Last we introduce the risk-neutral probability (Definition 1.4, p.~6 in \cite{follmerschied:2004}), here see (Def.~\hyperlink{def:16}{16}). \par We give an example in real world: Suppose you have some assets like bonds (riskless assets). Then we can fix our price for these bonds with $x$ for today and $x\cdot(1+r)$ for tomorrow, $r$ is the interest rate. So we simply assume, that in every possible market evolution of tomorrow we have a determinated value. Then every probability measure of $\Omega_{fut1}$ is a risk-neutral measure, see (\hyperlink{th:21}{21}). This example shows the existence of some risk-neutral measure. If you find more than one of them, you can determine -- with an additional condition to the probability measures -- whether a market model is arbitrage free or not (see Theorem 1.6. in \cite{follmerschied:2004}, p.~6.) \par A short graph for (\hyperlink{th:21}{21}): \par Suppose we have a portfolio with many (in this example infinitely many) assets. For asset $d$ we have the price $\pi(d)$ for today, and the price $\pi(d)\cdot(1+r)$ for tomorrow with some interest rate $r>0$. \par Let G be a sequence of random variables on $\Omega_{fut1}$, Borel sets. So you have many functions $f_{k}:\{1,2,3,4\} \rightarrow R$ with $G(k)=f_{k}$ and $f_{k}$ is a random variable of $\Omega_{fut1}$, Borel sets. For every $f_{k}$ we have $f_{k}(w)=\pi(k)\cdot(1+r)$ for $w \in \{1,2,3,4\}$. \\ \\ \begin{center} $ {\begin{array}{cp{0.2cm}c} \strut\mkern80mu Today & & Tomorrow\strut\mkern80mu\\ \\ \multicolumn{1}{r}{\rm ~only~one~scenario} & & \multicolumn{1}{l}{\left\{ \begin{array}{l} w_{21}=\{1,2\},\\ w_{22}=\{3,4\},\\ \end{array}\right \phantom{\}}.} \\ \\ \multicolumn{1}{r}{{\rm ~for~all~} d \in \mathbb{N} {\rm ~holds}~ \pi(d)} & & \left\{ \begin{array}{l} f_{d}(w)=G(d)(w)=\pi(d)\cdot(1+r),\\ w \in w_{21} {\rm ~or~} w \in w_{22},\\ r>0 {\rm ~is~the~interest~rate.} \end{array}\right \phantom{\}}. \\ \end{array}} $ \end{center} Here, every probability measure of $\Omega_{fut1}$ is a risk-neutral measure.   },

    SUMMARY = {We show that the set of all partial predicates over a set $D$ together with the disjunction, conjunction, and negation operations, defined in accordance with the truth tables of S.C. Kleene's strong logic of indeterminacy \cite{Kleene1952}, forms a~Kleene algebra. A~Kleene algebra is a~De Morgan algebra \cite{Brignole1964} (also called quasi-Boolean algebra) which satisfies the condition $x \wedge \neg x \le y \vee \neg y$ (sometimes called the normality axiom). We use the formalization of De Morgan algebras from \cite{ROBBINS1.ABS}. \par The term ``Kleene algebra'' was introduced by A.~Monteiro and D.~Brignole in \cite{Brignole1964}. A~similar notion of a~``normal i-lattice'' had been previously studied by J.A. Kalman \cite{Kalman1958}. More details about the origin of this notion and its relation to other notions can be found in \cite{Monteiro1996,Cignoli1975,Balbes,Blyth1994}. It should be noted that there is a~different widely known class of algebras, also called Kleene algebras \cite{Kozen1990,Conway1971}, which generalize the algebra of regular expressions, however, the term ``Kleene algebra'' used in this paper does not refer to them. \par Algebras of partial predicates naturally arise in computability theory in the study on partial recursive predicates. They were studied in connection with non-classical logics \cite{Kleene1952,Cleave1991,Korner1966,RasiowaNonClassical,NikitchShkilniak2013,NikShk2017:QE-calculus}. A~partial predicate also corresponds to the notion of a~partial set \cite{Negri1998} on a~given domain, which represents a (partial) property which for any given element of this domain may hold, not hold, or neither hold nor not hold. The field of all partial sets on a~given domain is an algebra with generalized operations of union, intersection, complement, and three constants (0, 1, $n$ which is the fixed point of complement) which can be generalized to an equational class of algebras called DMF-algebras (De Morgan algebras with a~single fixed point of involution) \cite{Negri1996}. In \cite{Negri2013} partial sets and DMF-algebras were considered as a~basis for unification of set-theoretic and linguistic approaches to probability. \par Partial predicates over classes of mathematical models of data were used for formalizing semantics of computer programs in the composition-nominative approach to program formalization \cite{Nikitch98,NikitchShkilniak2008,Skobelev2014,DBLP:journals/csjm/IvanovNS16}, for formalizing extensions of the Floyd-Hoare logic \cite{Floyd1967,Hoare1969} which allow reasoning about properties of programs in the case of partial pre- and postconditions \cite{Kryvolap2013,KornilowiczetalICTERI2017,DBLP:conf/fedcsis/KornilowiczKNI17,Kornilowicz2018}, for formalizing dynamical models with partial behaviors in the context of the mathematical systems theory \cite{Ivanov2014,Ivanov2014a,PETERSON.ABS,Ivanov2016,DBLP:journals/corr/Ivanov17}.   },

We formalized Fubini's theorem in our previous article \cite{MEASUR11.ABS}, but in that case we showed the Fubini's theorem for measurable sets and it was not enough as the integral does not appear explicitly. \par On the other hand, the theorems obtained in this paper are more general and it can be easily extended to a general integrable function.

    SUMMARY = {Even and odd numbers appear early in history of mathematics \cite{Zazkis1998}, as they serve to describe the property of objects easily noticeable by human eye \cite{sawyer2003vision}. Although the use of parity allowed to discover irrational numbers \cite{russo2013forgotten}, there is a common opinion that this property is ``not rich enough to become the main content focus of any particular research" \cite{Zazkis1998}. \par On the other hand, due to the use of decimal system, divisibility by 2 is often regarded as the property of the last digit of a number (similarly to divisibility by 5, but not to divisibility by any other primes), which probably restricts its use for any advanced purposes. \par The article aims to extend the definition of parity towards its notion in binary representation of integers, thus making an alternative to the articles grouped in \cite{BINARITH.ABS}, \cite{NUMERAL1.ABS}, and \cite{RADIX_1.ABS} branches, formalized in Mizar \cite{Mizar-State-2015}, \cite{BancerekJAR:2018}.   },

      SUMMARY = {Drawing a finite graph is usually done by a finite sequence of the following three operations. \begin{enumerate} \item Draw a vertex of the graph. \item Draw an edge between two vertices of the graph. \item Draw an edge starting from a vertex of the graph and immediately draw a vertex at the other end of it. \end{enumerate} By this procedure any finite graph can be constructed. This property of graphs is so obvious that the author of this article has yet to find a reference where it is mentioned explicitly. In introductionary books (like \cite{SIMPLE}, \cite{MULTI}, \cite{German}) as well as in advanced ones (like \cite{SELECTED}), after the initial definition of graphs the examples are usually given by graphical representations rather than explicit set theoretic descriptions, assuming a mutual understanding how the representation is to be translated into a description fitting the definition. However, Mizar \cite{Mizar-State-2015}, \cite{BancerekJAR:2018} does not possess this innate ability of humans to translate pictures into graphs. Therefore, if one wants to create graphs in Mizar without directly providing a set theoretic description (i.e. using the {\texttt{createGraph}} functor), a rigorous approach to the constructing operations is required.\par In this paper supergraphs are defined as an inverse mode to subgraphs as given in \cite{GLIB_000.ABS}. The three graph construction operations are defined as modes extending {\texttt{Supergraph}} similar to how the various remove operations were introduced as submodes of {\texttt{Subgraph}} in \cite{GLIB_000.ABS}. Many theorems are proven that describe how graph properties are transferred to special supergraphs. In particular, to prove that disconnected graphs cannot become connected by adding an edge between two vertices that lie in the same component, the theory of replacing a part of a walk with another walk is introduced in the preliminaries.   },

In this paper another such operation is formalized in Mizar \cite{Mizar-State-2015}, \cite{BancerekJAR:2018}: drawing a vertex and then immediately drawing edges connecting this vertex with a subset of the other vertices of the graph. In case the new vertex is joined with all vertices of a given graph $G$, this is known as the join of $G$ and the trivial loopless graph $K_1$. While the join of two graphs is known and found in standard literature (like \cite{SIMPLE}, \cite{MULTI}, \cite{German} and \cite{SELECTED}), the operation discribed in this article is not.\par Alongside the new operation a mode to reverse the directions of a subset of the edges of a graph is introduced. When all edge directions of a graph are reversed, this is commonly known as the converse of a (directed) graph.   },

The rules are formalized on the semantic level. The details of the approach used to implement this formalization are described in \cite{Moldova2018}. \par We formalize the notion of a~semantic Floyd-Hoare triple (for an extended Floyd-Hoare logic with partial pre- and post-conditions) \cite{Moldova2018} which is a~triple of a~pre-condition represented by a~partial predicate, a~program, represented by a~partial function which maps data to data, and a~post-condition, represented by a~partial predicate, which informally means that if the pre-condition on a~program's input data is defined and true, and the program's output after a~run on this data is defined (a~program terminates successfully), and the post-condition is defined on the program's output, then the post-condition is true. \par We formalize and prove the soundness of the rules of the inference system \cite{Kryvolap2013,KornilowiczetalICTERI2017} for such semantic Floyd-Hoare triples. For reasoning about sequential composition of programs and while loops we use the rules proposed in \cite{SeqRule2018}. \par The formalized rules can be used for reasoning about sequential programs, and in particular, for sequential programs on nominative data \cite{NOMIN_1.ABS}. Application of these rules often requires reasoning about partial predicates representing pre- and post-conditions which can be done using the formalized results on the Kleene algebra of partial predicates given in \cite{PARTPR_1.ABS}.   },

These equations are explored in the proof of Matiyasevich's negative solution of Hilbert's tenth problem. \par In our previous work \cite{HILB10_1.ABS}, we showed that from the Diophantine standpoint these equations can be obtained from lists of several basic Diophantine relations as linear equations, finite products, congruences and inequalities. In this formalization, we express these relations in terms of Diophantine set introduced in \cite{HILB10_2.ABS}. We prove that these relations are Diophantine and then we prove several second-order theorems that provide the ability to combine Diophantine relation using conjunctions and alternatives as well as to substitute the right-hand side of a given Diophantine equality as an argument in a given Diophantine relation. Finally, we investigate the possibilities of our approach to prove that the two equations, being the main purpose of this formalization, are Diophantine. \par The formalization by means of Mizar system \cite{BancerekJAR:2018}, \cite{Mizar-State-2015} follows Z.~Adamowicz, P.~Zbierski \cite{AdamowiczZbierski} as well as M.~Davis~\cite{Hilbert10}.   },

      SUMMARY = {This article covers some technical aspects about the product topology which are usually not given much of a thought in mathematics and standard literature like \cite{MUNKRES} and \cite{kelley}, not even by Bourbaki in \cite{BOURBAKI}. \par Let $\{\mathcal T_i\}_{i\in I}$ be a family of topological spaces. The prebasis of the product space $\mathcal T=\prod_{i\in I} \mathcal T_i$ is defined in \cite{WAYBEL18.ABS} as the set of all $\pi^{-1}_i(V)$ with $i\in I$ and $V$ open in $\mathcal T_i$. Here it is shown that the basis generated by this prebasis consists exactly of the sets $\prod_{i\in I} V_i$ with $V_i$ open in $ \mathcal T_i$ and for all but finitely many $i\in I$ holds $V_i=\mathcal T_i$. Given $I=\{a\}$ we have $ \mathcal T\cong \mathcal T_a$, given $I=\{a,b\}$ with $a\neq b$ we have $\mathcal T \cong \mathcal T_a \times\mathcal T_b$. Given another family of topological spaces $\{\mathcal S_i\}_{i\in I}$ such that $\mathcal S_i\cong\mathcal T_i$ for all $i\in I$, we have $\mathcal S=\prod_{i\in I} \mathcal S_i\cong \mathcal T$. If instead $S_i$ is a subspace of $T_i$ for each $i\in I$, then $\mathcal S$ is a subspace of $\mathcal T$. \par These results are obvious for mathematicians, but formally proven here by means of the Mizar system \cite{BancerekJAR:2018}, \cite{Mizar-State-2015}.   },

    SUMMARY = {The coexistence of ``classical" {\it finite sequences} \cite{FINSEQ_1.ABS} and their zero-based equivalents {\it finite 0-sequences} \cite{AFINSQ_1.ABS} in Mizar has been regarded as a disadvantage. However the suggested replacement of the former type with the latter \cite{Rudnicki2003} has not yet been implemented, despite of several advantages of this form, such as the identity of length and domain operators \cite{kornilowicz2009define}. On the other hand the number of theorems formalized using {\it finite sequence} notation is much larger then of those based on {\it finite 0-sequences}, so such translation would require quite an effort. \par The paper addresses this problem with another solution, using the Mizar system \cite{FourDecades}, \cite{BancerekJAR:2018}. Instead of removing one notation it is possible to introduce operators which would concatenate sequences of various types, and in this way allow utilization of the whole range of formalized theorems. While the operation could replace existing {\tt FS2XFS}, {\tt XFS2FS} commands (by using empty sequences as initial elements) its universal notation (independent on sequences that are concatenated to the initial object) allows to ``forget" about the type of sequences that are concatenated on further positions, and thus simplify the proofs.   },

      SUMMARY = {Using Mizar \cite{Mizar-State-2015}, in the context of a real vector space, we introduce the concept of affine ratio of three aligned points (see \cite{bsl0}). \par It is also equivalent to the notion of ``Mesure alg{\' e}brique"\footnote{\tt{https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesure\_alg{\' e}brique}}, to the opposite of the notion of Teilverh\"{a}ltnis\footnote{\tt{https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teilverh{\" a}ltnis}} or to the opposite of the ordered length-ratio \cite{richter2011perspectives}. \par In the second part, we introduce the classic notion of ``cross-ratio" of 4 points aligned in a real vector space. \par Finally, we show that if the real vector space is the real line, the notion corresponds to the classical notion\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-ratio}} \cite{richter2011perspectives}: \begin{quote} The cross-ratio of a quadruple of distinct points on the real line with coordinates $x_1, x_2,x_3,x_4$ is given by: $$(x_1,x_2;x_3,x_4) = \frac{x_3 - x_1}{x_3 - x_2}. \frac{x_4 - x_2}{x_4 - x_1}$$ \end{quote} \par In the Mizar Mathematical Library, the vector spaces were first defined by Kusak, Leo\'{n}czuk and Muzalewski in the article \cite{VECTSP_1.ABS}, while the actual real vector space was defined by Trybulec \cite{RLVECT_1.ABS} and the complex vector space was defined by Endou \cite{CLVECT_1.ABS}. Nakasho and Shidama have developed a solution to explore the notions introduced by different authors\footnote{\url{http://webmizar.cs.shinshu-u.ac.jp/mmlfe/current}} \cite{nakasho2015documentation}. The definitions can be directly linked in the HTMLized version of the Mizar library\footnote{\scriptsize Example: {\tt RealLinearSpace} \tt{http://mizar.org/version/current/html/rlvect\_1.html\#NM2}}. \par The study of the cross-ratio will continue within the framework of the Klein-Beltrami model \cite{BKMODEL1.ABS}, \cite{BKMODEL2.ABS}.

For any natural numbers $a$, $b$, $n$, ``right--to--left binary algorithm" can calculate the natural number, see (Def.~\hyperlink{def:2}{2}), ${\rm Algo}_{\rm BPow}(a,n,m):=a^b \bmod n$ and for any integers $a$, $b$, ``Euclidean algorithm" can calculate the non negative integer ${\rm gcd}(a, b)$. We have not formalized computational complexity of algorithms yet, though we had already formalize the ``Euclidean algorithm" in \cite{NTALGO_1.ABS}. \par For ``right-to-left binary algorithm", we formalize the theorem, which says that the required number of the modular squares and modular products in this algorithms are $1+\lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor$ and for ``Euclidean algorithm", we formalize the Lam{\' e}'s theorem \cite{Lame:1844}, which says the required number of the divisions in this algorithm is at most $5 \log_{10} \min(|a|,|b|)$. Our aim is to support the implementation of number theoretic tools and evaluating computational complexities of algorithms to prove the security of cryptographic systems.   },

    AUTHOR = {Schwarzweller, Christoph},
    ADDRESS1 = {Institute of Informatics\\University of Gda{\'n}sk\\Poland},
      SUMMARY = {This is the first part of a four-article series containing a Mizar \cite{GrabKornSchwarz:2016}, \cite{Mizar-State-2015}, \cite{BancerekJAR:2018} formalization of Kronecker's construction about roots of polynomials in field extensions, i.e. that for every field $F$ and every polynomial $p \in F[X] \backslash F$ there exists a field extension $E$ of $F$ such that $p$ has a root over $E$. The formalization follows Kronecker's classical proof using $F[X]\slash\!\!<\!\!p\!\!>$ as the desired field extension $E$ \cite{Rad91alg1}, \cite{Jac85}, \cite{HL99}.\par In this first part we show that an irreducible polynomial $p \in F[X] \backslash F$ has a root over $F[X]\slash\!\!<\!\!p\!\!>$. Note, however, that this statement cannot be true in a rigid formal sense: We do not have $F \subseteq F[X]\slash\!\!<\!\!p\!\!>$ as sets, so $F$ is not a subfield of $F[X]\slash\!\!<\!\!p\!\!>$, and hence formally $p$ is not even a polynomial over $F[X]\slash\!\!<\!\!p\!\!>$. Consequently, we translate $p$ along the canonical monomorphism $\phi : F \longrightarrow F[X]\slash\!\!<\!\!p\!\!>$ and show that the translated polynomial $\phi(p)$ has a root over $F[X]\slash\!\!<\!\!p\!\!>$.\par Because $F$ is not a subfield of $F[X]\slash\!\!<\!\!p\!\!>$ we construct in the second part the field $(E\, \backslash \, \phi F) \cup F$ for a given monomorphism $\phi : F \longrightarrow E$ and show that this field both is isomorphic to $F$ and includes $F$ as a subfield. In the literature this part of the proof usually consists of saying that ``one can identify $F$ with its image $\phi F$ in $F[X]\slash\!\!<\!\!p\!\!>$ and therefore consider $F$ as a subfield of $F[X]\slash\!\!<\!\!p\!\!>$". Interestingly, to do so we need to assume that $F \cap E = \emptyset$, in particular Kronecker's construction can be formalized for fields $F$ with $F \cap F[X] = \emptyset$.\par Surprisingly, as we show in the third part, this condition is not automatically true for arbitray fields $F$: With the exception of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ we construct for every field $F$ an isomorphic copy $F'$ of $F$ with $F' \cap F'[X] \neq \emptyset$. We also prove that for Mizar's representations of $\mathbb{Z}_n$, $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R}$ we have $\mathbb{Z}_n \cap \mathbb{Z}_n[X] = \emptyset$, $\mathbb{Q} \cap \mathbb{Q}[X] = \emptyset$ and $\mathbb{R} \cap \mathbb{R}[X] = \emptyset$, respectively.\par In the fourth part we finally define field extensions: $E$ is a field extension of $F$ iff $F$ is a subfield of $E$. Note, that in this case we have $F \subseteq E$ as sets, and thus a polynomial $p$ over $F$ is also a polynomial over $E$. We then apply the construction of the second part to $F[X]\slash\!\!<\!\!p\!\!>$ with the canonical monomorphism $\phi : F \longrightarrow F[X]\slash\!\!<\!\!p\!\!>$. Together with the first part this gives - for fields $F$ with $F \cap F[X] = \emptyset$ - a field extension $E$ of $F$ in which $p \in F[X] \backslash F$ has a root.   },

    SUMMARY = {In this article, using the Mizar system \cite{FourDecades}, \cite{BancerekJAR:2018}, we discuss invertible operators on Banach spaces. In the first chapter, we formalized the theorem that denotes any operators that are close enough to an invertible operator are also invertible by using the property of Neumann series.\par In the second chapter, we formalized the continuity of an isomorphism that maps an invertible operator on Banach spaces to its inverse. These results are used in the proof of the implicit function theorem. We referred to \cite{miyadera:1972}, \cite{yoshida:1980}, \cite{Schwartz1997a}, \cite{Schwartz1997b} in this formalization.   },

      SUMMARY = {This is the second part of a four-article series containing a Mizar \cite{FourDecades}, \cite{BancerekJAR:2018} formalization of Kronecker's construction about roots of polynomials in field extensions, i.e. that for every field $F$ and every polynomial $p \in F[X] \backslash F$ there exists a field extension $E$ of $F$ such that $p$ has a root over $E$. The formalization follows Kronecker's classical proof using $F[X]\slash\!\!<\!\!p\!\!>$ as the desired field extension $E$ \cite{Rad91alg1}, \cite{Jac85}, \cite{HL99}.\par In the first part we show that an irreducible polynomial $p \in F[X] \backslash F$ has a root over $F[X]\slash\!\!<\!\!p\!\!>$. Note, however, that this statement cannot be true in a rigid formal sense: We do not have $F \subseteq F[X]\slash\!\!<\!\!p\!\!>$ as sets, so $F$ is not a subfield of $F[X]\slash\!\!<\!\!p\!\!>$, and hence formally $p$ is not even a polynomial over $F[X]\slash\!\!<\!\!p\!\!>$. Consequently, we translate $p$ along the canonical monomorphism $\phi : F \longrightarrow F[X]\slash\!\!<\!\!p\!\!>$ and show that the translated polynomial $\phi(p)$ has a root over $F[X]\slash\!\!<\!\!p\!\!>$. \par Because $F$ is not a subfield of $F[X]\slash\!\!<\!\!p\!\!>$ we construct in this second part the field $(E\, \backslash \, \phi F) \cup F$ for a given monomorphism $\phi : F \longrightarrow E$ and show that this field both is isomorphic to $F$ and includes $F$ as a subfield. In the literature this part of the proof usually consists of saying that ``one can identify $F$ with its image $\phi F$ in $F[X]\slash\!\!<\!\!p\!\!>$ and therefore consider $F$ as a subfield of $F[X]\slash\!\!<\!\!p\!\!>$". Interestingly, to do so we need to assume that $F \cap E = \emptyset$, in particular Kronecker's construction can be formalized for fields $F$ with $F \cap F[X] = \emptyset$. \par Surprisingly, as we show in the third part, this condition is not automatically true for arbitray fields $F$: With the exception of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ we construct for every field $F$ an isomorphic copy $F'$ of $F$ with $F' \cap F'[X] \neq \emptyset$. We also prove that for Mizar's representations of $\mathbb{Z}_n$, $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R}$ we have $\mathbb{Z}_n \cap \mathbb{Z}_n[X] = \emptyset$, $\mathbb{Q} \cap \mathbb{Q}[X] = \emptyset$ and $\mathbb{R} \cap \mathbb{R}[X] = \emptyset$, respectively. \par In the fourth part we finally define field extensions: $E$ is a field extension of $F$ iff $F$ is a subfield of $E$. Note, that in this case we have $F \subseteq E$ as sets, and thus a polynomial $p$ over $F$ is also a polynomial over $E$. We then apply the construction of the second part to $F[X]\slash\!\!<\!\!p\!\!>$ with the canonical monomorphism $\phi : F \longrightarrow F[X]\slash\!\!<\!\!p\!\!>$. Together with the first part this gives - for fields $F$ with $F \cap F[X] = \emptyset$ - a field extension $E$ of $F$ in which $p \in F[X] \backslash F$ has a root.   },

      SUMMARY = {This article is the final step of our attempts to formalize the negative solution of Hilbert's tenth problem. \par In our approach, we work with the Pell's Equation defined in~\cite{PELLS_EQ.ABS}. We analyzed this equation in the general case to show its solvability as well as the cardinality and shape of all possible solutions. Then we focus on a special case of the equation, which has the form $x^2-(a^2-1)y^2=1$~\cite{HILB10_1.ABS} and its solutions considered as two sequences $\{x_{i}(a)\}_{i=0}^\infty$, $\{y_{i}(a)\}_{i=0}^\infty$. We showed in~\cite{HILB10_3.ABS} that the $n$-th element of these sequences can be obtained from lists of several basic Diophantine relations as linear equations, finite products, congruences and inequalities, or more precisely that the equation $x=y_{i}(a)$ is Diophantine. Following the post-Matiyasevich results we show that the equality determined by the value of the power function $y = x^z$ is Diophantine, and analogously property in cases of the binomial coefficient, factorial and several product~\cite{HILB10_4.ABS}. \par In this article, we combine analyzed so far Diophantine relation using conjunctions, alternatives as well as substitution to prove the bounded quantifier theorem. Based on this theorem we prove MDPR-theorem that {\it every recursively enumerable set is Diophantine,} where recursively enumerable sets have been defined by the Martin Davis normal form. \par The formalization by means of Mizar system \cite{BancerekJAR:2018}, \cite{FourDecades}, \cite{Mizar-State-2015} follows \cite{LNT:Smorynski}, Z.

Consequently, we translate $p$ along the canonical monomorphism $\phi : F \longrightarrow F[X]\slash\!\!<\!\!p\!\!>$ and show that the translated polynomial $\phi(p)$ has a root over $F[X]\slash\!\!<\!\!p\!\!>$.\par Because $F$ is not a subfield of $F[X]\slash\!\!<\!\!p\!\!>$ we construct in the second part the field $(E\, \backslash \, \phi F) \cup F$ for a given monomorphism $\phi : F \longrightarrow E$ and show that this field both is isomorphic to $F$ and includes $F$ as a subfield. In the literature this part of the proof usually consists of saying that ``one can identify $F$ with its image $\phi F$ in $F[X]\slash\!\!<\!\!p\!\!>$ and therefore consider $F$ as a subfield of $F [X]\slash\!\!<\!\!p\!\!>$". Interestingly, to do so we need to assume that $F \cap E = \emptyset$, in particular Kronecker's construction can be formalized for fields $F$ with $F \cap F[X] = \emptyset$.\par Surprisingly, as we show in this third part, this condition is not automatically true for arbitrary fields $F$: With the exception of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ we construct for every field $F$ an isomorphic copy $F'$ of $F$ with $F' \cap F'[X] \neq \emptyset$. We also prove that for Mizar's representations of $\mathbb{Z}_n$, $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{R}$ we have $\mathbb{Z}_n \cap \mathbb{Z}_n[X] = \emptyset$, $\mathbb{Q} \cap \mathbb{Q}[X] = \emptyset$ and $\mathbb{R} \cap \mathbb{R}[X] = \emptyset$, respectively.\par In the fourth part we finally define field extensions: $E$ is a field extension of $F$ iff $F$ is a subfield of $E$. Note, that in this case we have $F \subseteq E$ as sets, and thus a polynomial $p$ over $F$ is also a polynomial over $E$. We then apply the construction of the second part to $F[X]\slash\!\!<\!\!p\! \!>$ with the canonical monomorphism $\phi : F \longrightarrow F[X]\slash\!\!<\!\!p\!\!>$. Together with the first part this gives -- for fields $F$ with $F \cap F[X] = \emptyset$ -- a field extension $E$ of $F$ in which $p \in F[X] \backslash F$ has a root.   },

Such mappings map some vertices and edges of a graph to another while preserving adjacency. While this general approach is appropriate for the general form of (multidi)graphs as introduced in \cite{GLIB_000.ABS}, a more specialized version for graphs without parallel edges seems convenient.

      SUMMARY = {In this article, we prove, using the Mizar \cite{BancerekJAR:2018} formalism, a number of properties that correspond to the AIM Conjecture. In the first section, we define division operations on loops, inner mappings $T$, $L$ and $R$, commutators and associators and basic attributes of interest. We also consider subloops and homomorphisms. Particular subloops are the nucleus and center of a loop and kernels of homomorphisms. Then in Section~2, we define a set \mbox{Mlt $Q$} of multiplicative mappings of $Q$ and cosets (mostly following Albert 1943 for cosets~\cite{Albert43}). Next, in Section~3 we define the notion of a normal subloop and construct quotients by normal subloops. In the last section we define the set \mbox{InnAut} of inner mappings of $Q$, define the notion of an AIM loop and relate this to the conditions on $T$, $L$, and $R$ defined by satisfies \mbox{TT}, etc. We prove in Theorem~(67) that the nucleus of an AIM loop is normal and finally in Theorem~(68) that the AIM Conjecture follows from knowing every AIM loop satisfies \mbox{aa1}, \mbox{aa2}, \mbox{aa3}, \mbox{Ka}, \mbox{aK1}, \mbox{aK2} and \mbox{aK3}. \par The formalization follows M.K.

      SUMMARY = {Rough sets, developed by Pawlak \cite{Pawlak1982}, are important tool to describe situation of incomplete or partially unknown information. In this article, continuing the formalization of rough sets \cite{ROUGHS_5.ABS}, we give the formal characterization of three rough inclusion functions (RIFs). We start with the standard one, $\kappa^{\pounds}$, connected with {\L}ukasiewicz \cite{Lukasiewicz:1913}, and extend this research for two additional RIFs: $\kappa_1$, and $\kappa_2$, following a paper by Gomoli{\'n}ska \cite{GomolinskaRIF2008}, \cite{GomolinskaRIF2007}. We also define q-RIFs and weak q-RIFs \cite{Gomolinska2009}. The paper establishes a formal counterpart of \cite{GrabowskiIJCRS2019} and makes a preliminary step towards rough mereology \cite{PolkowskiRM2011}, \cite{PolkowskiS:1996} in Mizar \cite{FourDecades}.   },

We define the circuit structure of the tree constructions of the Generalized Full Adder Circuits (GFAs). We then successfully prove its circuit stability of the calculation outputs after four and six steps. The motivation for this research is to establish a technique based on formalized mathematics and its applications for calculation circuits with high reliability, and to implement the applications of the reliable logic synthesizer and hardware compiler \cite{Iwasaki:2008}.   },

A~construction of the ring of fractions from an integral domain, namely a quotient field was formalized in \cite{QUOFIELD.ABS}. \par This article generalizes a construction of fractions to a ring which is commutative and has zero divisor by means of a multiplicatively closed set, say $S$, by known manner. Constructed ring of fraction is denoted by $S$\textasciitilde$R$ instead of $S^{-1}R$ appeared in \cite{atiyah1969introduction}, \cite{matsumura1989}. As an important example we formalize a ring of fractions by a particular multiplicatively closed set, namely $R\smallsetminus\mathfrak{p}$, where $\mathfrak{p}$ is a prime ideal of $R$. The resulted local ring is denoted by ${R_{\mathfrak{p}}}$. In our Mizar article it is coded by $R$\textasciitilde ${\mathfrak{p}}$ as a synonym. \par This article contains also the formal proof of a universal property of a ring of fractions, the total-quotient ring, a proof of the equivalence between the total-quotient ring and the quotient field of an integral domain.   },

    SUMMARY = {The subset sum problem is a basic problem in the field of theoretical computer science, especially in the complexity theory \cite{Complexity:1972}. The input is a sequence of positive integers and a target positive integer. The task is to determine if there exists a subsequence of the input sequence with sum equal to the target integer. It is known that the problem is NP-hard~\cite{Karp1972} and can be solved by dynamic programming in pseudo-polynomial time~\cite{Garey:1979}. In this article we formalize the recurrence relation of the dynamic programming.   },

However, the measure introduced by Bia{\l}as limited the outer measure to a field with finite additivity. So, although it satisfies the nature of the measure, it cannot specify the length of measurable sets and also it cannot determine what kind of set is a measurable set. From the above, the authors first determined the length of the interval by the outer measure. Specifically, we used the compactness of the real space. Next, we constructed the pre-measure by limiting the outer measure to a semialgebra of intervals. Furthermore, by repeating the extension of the previous measure, we reconstructed the one-dimensional Lebesgue measure \cite{FOLLAND}, \cite{Bauer:2002}.   },

This work is a continuation of the development of fuzzy sets \cite{Zadeh:1965}, \cite{DuboisPrade:1980} in Mizar \cite{GrabowskiFuzzy:2013} started in \cite{FUZZY_1.ABS} and partially described in \cite{Grabowski2018}.
